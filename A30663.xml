            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY great miracles do the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend to be frequently wrought <hi>By</hi> the Holy Sacrament of the Altar, but none ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable as what their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors wrought <hi>Upon</hi> it: For what more wonderful than This, that a particular
<pb facs="tcp:59001:3"/> Church, by colour of a Tradition, ſhould prevail with All other Churches throughout the whole Christian world, to reneg That Constancy, which was univerſally practiſed as indiſpenſible for more than <hi>400</hi> years? That from Diſpenſing they ſhould proceed to Diſcouraging, and therein ſo prevail, that thoſe who have freed themſelvs from their many other groſs abuſes, cannot from This; but ſtill believ our Lord more honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Forbearing his Table, than by Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting it?</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to this Vulgar error, I have in my narrow Sphaere uſed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endeavors, but with ſo litle fruit, that I must either ſit down in deſpair, or fly to the laſt remedy, <hi>Writeing:</hi> which beſide the advantage of faſtening conviction better up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe few that ly under My inſpection,
<pb facs="tcp:59001:3"/> may extend it to as many others as ſhall bring my papers under Theirs.</p>
            <p>But here alſo I meet great diſcoragements: I ſee that many worthy perſons have of late be'n as careful to exhort to the Performance of the Duty, as to Worthineſs in it: but with no better ſucceſs, than thoſe firſt meſſengers, who's kind Invitations brought nothing to the Lord of the Feſt, but variety of excuſes.</p>
            <p>If therefor I would conform either to the Parable or to Reaſon, I muſt proceed to rougher means, compell by force of irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable arguments, the unwilling and reſiſting world, and by all cogent proofs aſſert a Truth, which by Many ages was never Doubted, by More generally Denyed, by Ours ſomtimes Affirmed, but never (that I know) clearly proved, <hi>viz. that it is every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans duty to be a Conſtant Communicant.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59001:4"/>
            <p>And this I have do'n with Such evidence, that I fear not any mans confutation; yet with litl hope to ſee <hi>the Table furniſhed with gueſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For alas! what can a poor Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion do, toward ſubduing ſuch an error, double armed with Prejudice in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Partiality in the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, fortified with long Poſſeſſion, defended by the Prieſts, and beloved by the Peopl?</p>
            <p>I muſt therefor be unfaithful both to the ſervice I have undertaken, and to Your <hi>Grace's</hi> right, ſhould I either expoſe it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and unſheltered to a Cold Adverſ world, or ſeek any other Patron than your <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as this Sacrament hath a double a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſo hath your <hi>Grace</hi> a double right to it's protection: As it is the greateſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Love and duty to our Lord, by your
<pb facs="tcp:59001:4"/> Eminence in Piety; As it is the Principal office of Church-worſhip, by your eminence in Power Eccleſiastical: By the former, every good chriſtian may claim common with your <hi>Grace</hi> in moſt of the following pages; but by the Later, your <hi>Grace</hi> hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar jurisdiction over ſome, particularly<note n="a" place="bottom">PART III. Chap. 1. Sect. 4.</note> thoſe wherein I have juſtified the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of our Church, as doing what in ſuch unhappy circumſtances, is poſſible for retriving Primitive Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>Could I ſay as much for the Practice! —But be it never ſo defective, it cannot hinder us from juſtifying our Church as well as St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf. For his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is no leſs generally mistaken for a derogation from That very obligation to conſtancy, which he employed it to prove indiſpenſible; than
<pb facs="tcp:59001:5"/> is the <hi>three times in every year,</hi> which our Church defines as the Leaſt that ſhe can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate in the Peopl, for the moſt that ſhe expecteth from the Priests; who therefor think themſelvs exactly conformable, if they minister it juſt ſo often and no more; though without any care, either Before-hand, to exhort the people to Receve it, or Afterward, to reprove them if they Neglect it; which yet they cannot avoid ſeeing them general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, being ſo taught and accuſtomed, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our confuſions, and ſtill biaſed by their ſloth, or worſe.</p>
            <p>What may be allowed for the untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the people under our preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, is not for Me to determin: But that thoſe very Diſtractions, which now toſs us between two ſuch parties, whereof the One firſt robbed the Sacrament of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb facs="tcp:59001:5"/> and the Other ſtrippeth it ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of All Performance, ly on us as a juſt puniſhment for our compliance with them, is plainly enough to be diſcovered, without any rude intruſion into God's ſecrets: For Conſtancy in This Office is apparently the moſt effectual means to unite us; as being both by it's own nature moſt ſerviceable thereto, and by its ſingular intereſt in our Lord's Perſon, ſingularly intitled to his Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>I therefor conceve it no impertinent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of thoſe great cares wherewith your <hi>Grace</hi> is too much molested, if as a kind of Church-warden-general, I make humble preſentment, of that defect in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches (eſpecially) which your reſidence in Cathedrals hath hindered you from diſcovering, bicauſe thoſe Officers who
<pb facs="tcp:59001:6"/> ought to be eyes to your <hi>Grace</hi> and our other Fathers in God, are themſelves blinded with the vulgar error;</p>
            <p>Whereof we ſaw a pernicious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the days of your <hi>Grace's</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate predeceſſor; when a General enquiry (made upon theſe Queſtions, <hi>1. How many inhabitants in your Pariſh? 2. How many refuſe to join in Communion with the Church?)</hi> proved abortive, bicauſe thoſe who refuſed to communicate in This Principal office, were not noted as <hi>refuſing to join in Communion with the Church;</hi> which had they ben, the neceſſity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſory means would have appeared ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that we had not now be'n in danger, to have our nineteenth Article urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, to diſprove our being a True Church.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59001:6"/>
            <p>I know my ſelf chargeable with a double great boldneſs; firſt in fronting theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers with your <hi>Grace's</hi> name, and then in the account <hi>I</hi> make for it: But when <hi>I</hi> firſt engaged in the work, <hi>I</hi> reſolved not to do it by halvs, and <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have omitted the better half, than This way of advantageing the whole: And ſince your <hi>Grace</hi> is ſo well known eminent for zeal in redreſſing whatever you ſhall find to need it; <hi>I</hi> have thence taken encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to believ, you would much more eaſily pardon ſuch a Preſumption, than ſuch an Omiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> therefor humbly recommend, not ſo much theſe Papers, as their Sacred ſubject, Our Lord's Inſtitution, and our Churches Conſtitutions, to your <hi>Grace's</hi> protection; as I do your <hi>Grace's</hi> Perſon and pious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Sacrament of the Lords Supper highly eſteemed by our Lord and all his Churches. In later Ages many differences of Opinions concerning it. <hi>II.</hi> Not the number only, but mater of the differences ſcandalos to the Scripture, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Papiſt and Jew. <hi>III.</hi> The blame removed from the Scriptures to the Doctors. <hi>IV.</hi> The Papiſts, beſt perhaps ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced by our claiming the literal ſens in the Wine as they do in the Bread. Our own Divines neglect the former part, which yet is the Head of the Apoſtl's diſcourſe. <hi>V.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way to underſtand his meaning.

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> The ſeeming impoſſibility and real neceſſity to add to what hath be'n already written concerning the Lords Supper. <hi>II.</hi> A double Objection, ſlighted yet anſwered and turned to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plea. The former concerning the dignity of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>III.</hi> The other concerning the deference due to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. A ſhort retroſpect upon the ſeveral ſtages of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from it. How later Fathers departed from the firſt. The Papiſts from the Fathers. <hi>IV.</hi> The Reformed Churches from the Papists. The Moderation of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> blamed by the Non-conconformiſts, who diſſented here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in One extream and now in Another. <hi>V.</hi> Our own Divines of the laſt age leſs juſtifiable than thoſe of the preſent; who do better, yet not enough. <hi>VI.</hi> The ſum of the account. A requeſt for rigid examination, and its reaſon. An example of noble Ladies: An advertiſement to the Reader.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER ſo many Treatiſes and Contentions concerning the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> it's Nature and Myſteries, the Duties we are to pay it, and the Benefits we are to receive from it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may well appear, not only need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to write any more upon ſo ſpent a ſubject, but impoſſible to do it without troubling the World with Repetitions of what hath already, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) too often, been ſaid by others.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59001:17"/>
            <p>But the complaint which our judicious <hi>Sandys</hi> made in behalf of the devout Pilgrims, who with great trouble and danger viſit the Holy Sepulchre, may well fit thoſe pious perſons, who travel in ſearch after our Lords mind in this Monument, raiſed with great care by himſelf in memory of his death.</p>
            <p>There the devout Pilgrim findeth the Grave it ſelf bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of his ſight, the herbs and flowers withered into coſtly, but dead Marble, and the glorious ſpatious Vault of Heaven, contracted into a much duller and meaner one, of a ſplendid magnificent Temple. And here, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious enquirer, findeth This Monument buried under ſo many incomprehenſible Myſteries, that the Sacrament of the Altar looks no more like the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> than doth the Temple of the Sepulchre like <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Garden.</p>
            <p>How much more had our learned and ingenious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, advanced both the honor of the Sacrament, and the intereſt of Souls; if in ſtead of thoſe Many, Great, and Fine Buildings, wherewith they have endeavored to beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and really hidden it; they had left us the naked <hi>Area:</hi> a Plain, Honeſt account of our Lords Meaning, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch points as are therefore neceſſary to be known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe we cannot conform our obedience to it: Such are Theſe,
<list>
                  <item>Whether our Lord intended more than he expreſſed? and how much?</item>
                  <item>Whether he intended to impoſe it upon us as a Command or no? and how much? and with what limitations?</item>
                  <item>Whether all Perſons be obliged to perform it? and how often?</item>
                  <item>Whether we may omit it in any caſe? and in what caſes?</item>
                  <item>Whether, and in what caſes we be not only permitted, but obliged to forbear?</item>
                  <item>Whether it be beſt to perform it ſeldom, or often, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59001:17"/>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are queſtions ſo obvious, yea ſo unavoidable, ly ſo directly in our way, ſo croſs it, and even block it up, that it may be wondered how Any one, much more how Every one, that pretendeth either to guide others, or follow his own light, ſhould (I cannot ſay Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but) Avoid them.</p>
            <p>For they ſerve not to tickle the Fancy, or ſcratch the Curioſity, but to inform the Conſcience; they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe us with impertinent Speculations, but direct us in neceſſary Duty; and that not in Collateral or Inferior, but in the Principal Articles: So that it ſeemeth no leſs than admirable, that any ſhould ſincerely deſire to keep a good Conſcience, yet neglect to underſtand his Obligations in the neceſſary points of Time and Frequency required.</p>
            <p>For unleſs we can believe that our Lord moſt carefully eſtabliſhed an Inſtitution, only to be talk'd of, ſtared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or fought for: If we believe a word of the <hi>Imperative Mode,</hi> muſt have an <hi>Imperative ſenſe:</hi> If we ſhould think our ſelves ill ſerved, when having commanded our ſervants to do ſome uſeful work, we ſhould find them buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in talking, or perhaps quareling about the wiſdom of the Command, or the uſefulneſs of the Work; and ſo leave the applauded Command unexecuted, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Work unperformed;</p>
            <p>Then, after ſo many Inventions, yea ſo many Veines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; after ſo much profuſion not only of Ink, but Blood, unhappily ſpilt upon this ſole Subject; it is not only Poſſible but Neceſſary, to write yet more concerning a Subject, ſo far from being ſpent, that it is untouched in thoſe Points which are moſt worthy our labor.</p>
            <p>For while ſome imploy their zeal in Diſputing, or worſe, concerning the manner of our <hi>Lords Preſence,</hi> and the Adoration due to it; and others, who deny Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrain Reverence to ſuch a pitch, as turns it to Fear: While they forbid us to approach the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> upon any other terms than we may ſafely come to his <hi>Judgement
<pb facs="tcp:59001:18"/> Seat;</hi> while our kinder Writers help us with Schemes for ſelf-examination and Forms of Devotion, that we may (if poſſible) come Worthy; but preſs the Duty ſo coldly, that it is queſtioned whether it be a Duty or no, and paſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that it is not one, to come at all Times: When ſo much is ſpoken to fright us from the Altar, and ſo little to oblige us to approach it, What other Fruit can we reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect from ſuch Labors but what we ſee?</p>
            <p>Many pay their Reverence by bowing their Knees to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> and turning their Backs upon the <hi>Holier Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> their Aw putteth them to as great diſtance as Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect can; and this occaſions others to cloak their real neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, under pretence of aw: ſo the ſlothful joyn with the fearful, to plead, <hi>There is a Lyon in the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many come only, <hi>Once in a year,</hi> as if our Lord intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſecrate none but the <hi>Paſsover:</hi> Others, not until they are dying, as if they were not to <hi>ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> but their own: Others, not at all, as if it were the duty of the Prieſt only, becauſe Inſtituted in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Apoſtles only; and upon one pretence or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the much greater part of the People never think of it at all, no not to their very death.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the moſt zealous Servants of our Lord lament, that his laſt, and therefore not leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, hath loſt the Obedience due to it: The greateſt lovers of Piety, that it hath loſt one of its greateſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, in the time of greateſt need: The moſt affectionate Sons of the Church, that ſhe hath in a manner loſt a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> an indiſpenſible mark of a true Church: The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt Friends of Peace, that ſhe hath worſe than loſt her beſt Cement, which is abuſed to an Inſtrument of Diviſion: And the moſt Prudent and Pious cry aloud, that it is a ſhame to our Government, and a wound to our Religion, that our practice ſhould give ſuch a publickly to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, when we read, <hi>That we are therefor one Bread, and one Body, bieauſe we eat of that one Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59001:18"/>
            <p>Since therefore the Work is equally neceſſary and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, he that ſhall labor in it will be ſecure from being blamed, as <hi>troubling the World with repetitions of trite Diſcourſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT then he ſhall be no leſs ſure of the contrary cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as doing it with New ones; and, which is worſe, as vilifying the <hi>adorable Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Temple of the Sepulchre,</hi> however venerable for the Antiquity of its Buildings, is much more ſo, for the Place they ſtand on; which though they do not ſo much Honor as Oppreſs, yet whoever ſhould endeavor to reſcue it from them, ſhould be doubly cenſured, as Sacrilegious both againſt the <hi>Holy Temple, and Holier Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoever will meaſure the Ground, whereon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking zeal of former Ages hath built ſo many and great Myſteries, cannot avoid ſhewing it uncapable to bear them; and conſequently muſt run a ſevere gandelope, laſhed on one ſide in behalf of Antiquity, and on the other in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. BUT, once throughly convinced of the Fitneſs, yea Neceſſity of the undertaking, theſe Fears move me no otherwiſe than to ſet me forward. From the Dignity of the Sacrament, I conclude it worthy my ſervice; and from the Duration of the Error, I conclude it to need it. Did not Both theſe concur, I ſhould not have raiſed Work for the Learned, or Game for the Cenſorious, by oppoſing a popular error in ſo Sacred a ſubject.</p>
            <p>Yet leſt that which ſets me forward to the Work, ſhould ſet me backward in the Succeſs, I think it requiſite to take ſuch notice of the double Objection, as to juſtifie my ſelf againſt both its parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. ONE part of the Objection concernerh the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sacrament, who's greatneſs I moſt heartily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59001:19"/>
            <p>I confeſs we may be guilty of the <hi>Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> in either ſenſe, That of the Inſtitution, or that of his preceding Doctrine, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. wherein he interpreteth <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> by <hi>believing.</hi> And therefor we ought to examine our ſelves before we Receive, much mote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Publiſh any Opinion concerning it, as carefully as before we receive the Sacrament it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But this is ſo far from a reaſon againſt <hi>Examination,</hi> that it pleads for it: For as Both ways we may be guilty of Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if we <hi>Receive unworthily</hi> either the Sacrament or the Opinion; ſo may we be of Neglect, if we conſider not what we are obliged both to Do and to Teach.</p>
            <p>I know a Gentlewoman that hardly eſcaped falling into water, becauſe a poor neighbor that ſtood neer her, and might eaſily have helpt her, forbore that good office; upon this reaſon (as ſhe afterward excuſed her ſelf) becauſe ſhe durſt not be ſo bold. Whoever accuſeth me of boldneſs toward the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> let him conſider, whether he would be pleaſed with ſuch reverence in a time of ſuch need.</p>
            <p>Whatever others do, certainly none of thoſe good men who ſo ſadly complain of the neglect, will blame him who labors the remedy: No, though he ſhould abate ſomewhat both of Fear toward the Sacrament, and of Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe former Ages, which teaching men to Dread, have by conſequence taught them to Shun it.</p>
            <p>Yet is there no ſuch danger. For neither will the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be a loſer, if in ſtead of the Superſtitious Dread which contradicts it's Nature, we pay it the Obedience which it requires, and the Love which it deſerves; nor true Antiquity, if inſtead of the Middle ages, we vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Firſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. 2. TO that OTHER part therefor of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I anſwer; that we ought to take none but the firſt and beſt Ages of the Church for our guides, in
<pb facs="tcp:59001:19"/> all ſuch Controverſies as are capable ſo to be determined: That thoſe which concern Matter of Fact, are Such; ſince the Practices of thoſe Ages are viſible, but not (alway) their Opinions, eſpecially in ſuch Modern Queſtions as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled them, to declare their judgments: That the <hi>publick Offices of Chriſtian Worſhip</hi> are viſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it muſt needs be a great crime for Later ages, therein to depart from their Fathers.</p>
            <p>All this I not only acknowledge, but urge, and I hope no man will deny that it was as true a thouſand years ſince. If therefor it appear, that the Middle ages have departed from the Firſt, we muſt nor follow but reform the Error; and whoever ſhall retrive the long loſt truth, ought not to be look'd upon as a Contemner, but faithful Servant of Antiquity; and ſo much the more deſerving, by how much longer the Error hath continued.</p>
            <p>That this is the preſent caſe needeth no other proof, than the Records of Matter of Fact, never in any caſe more legible; whereby we may eaſily diſcover by what ſteps we are go'n ſo far, from the authentick examples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſeveral immediatly ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>This though we ſhall meet another occaſion to examine, yet for preventing prejudices, which perhaps might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome from reading ſo far, I conceive fit here to offer in a more contracted Landſchape.</p>
            <p>THAT the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, for ſome hundreds of years, were as conſtant at the <hi>Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as at his <hi>Houſe,</hi> is ſo manifeſt, that thoſe who wanted not the Tentation, ever wanted the Face to deny it. And the Evaſions whereby ſome have endeavored to ſhun the unavoidable Evidence, are as plainly falſe, as the denyal it ſelf can be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>True it is</hi> (ſaith the moſt excellent of them) <hi>the Apoſtles did indefinitely admit the Faithful to the H. C. but they were perſons wholely inflamed with thoſe Fires,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo goes on,
<pb facs="tcp:59001:20"/> deſcribing them in ſuch Characters as may very well fit the Apoſtles themſelves; but how ill Some, if not Moſt of their Communicating Diſciples, is too manifeſt in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reproof, whereby one of the Apoſtles themſelves char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them with ſuch Debaucheries at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> as had been inexcuſable at their own; yet doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for Excommunicate, thogh he vehemently Reproves them.</p>
            <p>As long as there was any hope to prevail, his Succeſſots labored in the ſame contention for This <hi>Cup of the Lord,</hi> againſt That of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> but at laſt diſpairing of ſucceſs, and thinking it better to ſubmit to an Inconvenience than a Miſchief, changed the Primitive manner of Church-meetings, from Feaſting to Faſting; as upon another kind of neceſſity they had do'n the proper Seaſon, from Evening after Supper, to Morning before Day: well conſidering, that however ill a Faſting Feaſt, or a Morning Supper might ſound; yet thoſe or any other Solaeciſms, were leſs grievous, than ſuch Profaneneſs, as otherwiſe appeared e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Unavoidable and Intolerable.</p>
            <p>And as they changed the Circumſtances of the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo did they the Stile of their Writings: from exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Conſtancy, which in thoſe days appeared unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they tranſplanted all their endeavors into preſſing Reverence, which they ſaw too much wanting,</p>
            <p>Wherein that they might anſwer the then urgent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, they put all their ſtrength to bow the ſtick the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit way; ſpake ſuch glorious things as dazeled the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of the Readers, and advanced the Sacrament from their Contemt, firſt to their Admiration, and thence to their Fear.</p>
            <p>So that which in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s was made <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which was a pretty large ſtride, and ſoon followed by another: For, Shunning naturally follows Dreading, &amp; the people quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grew willing to avoid (if poſſible) the terrible duty,
<pb facs="tcp:59001:20"/> which in a while they ſo deſerted, that the Prieſt was left alone without Communicants.</p>
            <p>Nor were the People more willing to keep a diſtance from the dreadful Table, than the Prieſts were to encloſe it to themſelves: So, in ſuper-conformity to our <hi>Lord's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> and his <hi>Churches practice,</hi> the Prieſt celebrateth the Holy Supper in all Church-meetings (and upon worſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, often without any) and in compliance with the Peoples Superſtition and their own Intereſt, they diſpenſe with them for Communicating, which was another large ſtride.</p>
            <p>In another Age they widen the uſeful diſtance between themſelves and the people with a further ſtride: They paſs from Diſpenſing to Forbidding, not the whole indeed, but a full half. And thus at laſt, taking from the people the Need to do any thing, and the Power to do more than half, they are gotten ſo far from Primitive Doctrine and Practice, that they have rob'd the People of their Right; The command, of its Power; and the Inſtituion, not only of its Power but its Nature.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cup</hi> is metamorphoſed from a <hi>Cup of Euchariſt</hi> to a <hi>Cup of trembling;</hi> the Performance, from a Communion to a Spectacle; the Inſtitution, from a Command to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition; and the Bread which at firſt did, and ſtill ought to knead all Chriſts Members into <hi>one bread and one body,</hi> crumbles them into almoſt innumerable, and utterly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable diviſions.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. FOR many who are willing to be freed from an Obligation, are not ſo, to be rob'd of a Right; and the corruptions of <hi>Rome</hi> being now ſo ſwollen and ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they could no longer hold from breaking; Moſt, if not All the Reforming Churches, equalled the People with the Prieſts, as in their Right to the Cup, ſo in their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receive it.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> put any other difference
<pb facs="tcp:59001:21"/> between them, but only in her hopes concerning their Obedience, To the Prieſts therefor (from whom ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended better hopes) ſhe Enjoyneth; but to the People ſhe only Recommendeth conſtancy in the performance: By the former keeping up her claim, by the latter yielding to Neceſſity, which yet ſhe would not ſo far do as to leave even the People at liberty; but enjoyneth That, <hi>three times at leaſt in every year,</hi> which by her Injunctions to rhe Prieſts ſhe more than intimateth, deſireable <hi>at leaſt once in every week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This moderation toward the People, the Nonconformiſts heretofore complained of. For Mr. <hi>Gartwright,</hi> the chief oppoſer of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Altare Damaſcenum,</hi> the moſt violent cenſurer thereof in King <hi>James</hi> his time, would have all who are in the Churches Communion, forced to receive the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> condemning them who abſtein out of fear as guilty of Superſtition, and not to be born with: and had more authority for This, than other of their complaints.</p>
            <p>But the Melancholy proper to that Sect, would neither permit them to tarry long in That Extreme, nor ſtop till they came to the other. For they now take up for Piety That fear, which their predeceſſors condemned for intolerable Superſtition.</p>
            <p>While they had the Sceptre, they laid aſide the Holy Table, as uſeleſs to any other purpoſe but That of bringing their people to examination: when upon reſtitution of our Government, there appeared danger of reſtoring this Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to its aboliſhed power; they moved in a publick Conference, that the <hi>Rubrike</hi> which requireth <hi>every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioner to Communicate at leaſt three times in every year,</hi> might either be wholely left out, or ſo curtailed as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn no more but this, <hi>That the Communion ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated three times in every year, provided there were a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number to receive it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which to hinder, they employ their utmoſt diligence: For even thoſe among them who yield it lawful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb facs="tcp:59001:21"/> in our other offices of Pubick Worſhip, will by no means do it in This.</p>
            <p n="5">V. NOR are our own Divines (thoſe of the former Age I mean) altogether free of this humor: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of deference to the later Fathers, or an opinion that the Obligation being ſelf-evident needeth not be preſſed, or a conceit that Aw conduceth more to the advancement of Godlineſs, or for whatever other reaſon; plain it is, they have been more induſtrious to advance the honor of this Inſtitution, by our Fear, than by our Obedience: For they make the Conditions of worthineſs ſo ſtrict, and the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the performance ſo ſlack, as if they deſigned to fright us from the one, and free us from the other; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending (doubtleſs) upon our Church-Rubrikes, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice, for prevention of the inconvenience; and not intending to deal with the Sacrament, as ſome ſay our <hi>Rich:</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> was dealt with after his depoſition, ſerved <hi>a la royale</hi> with ſtore of coſtly Diſhes, his Eſquire taking the Eſſay, and all other pomps of Grandeur, but not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to taſt any thing, and ſo deſtroyed with Hunger and Ceremony.</p>
            <p>But to thoſe who ſince the Reſtoration have written on this ſubject, we muſt not deny our juſt acknowledgement; that as there is greater need, ſo have they uſed greater care to preſs the almoſt forgotten duty: Yet ſtill ſo, that their labors have not anſwered the neceſſity.</p>
            <p>For they all write <hi>Ad populum,</hi> and accommodate their Diſcourſes not to the amplitude of the Subject, but to the narrowneſs of their Readers capacities; whereby they are obliged to ſhun the ſtrongeſt, and confine themſelves to the weakeſt Arguments.</p>
            <p>Whereas he that will ſtem an Error, pretending both to Piety and Univerſality, and backed with the rarely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined aſſiſtance of the Peoples inclinations and the Paſtors ſilence, yea and encouragements; muſt conſult rather the
<pb facs="tcp:59001:22"/> neceſſity of the Subject, than the capacity of the vulgar, whoſe office is not to judge of Arguments, but obey Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations.</p>
            <p>For correction of Manners indeed, a plauſible Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Suaſory may therefore ſuffice, becauſe the Readers judgment is of the Authors party: But for conviction of Errors, where the Judgment concurs with the Affections in joint oppoſition, there muſt be ſuch greater ſtrength, as may not only fairly perſwade, but forcibly ſubdue Both.</p>
            <p>If ſuch Elenctik Diſcourſes be too unweildy for the weak vulgar, it is to be conſidered, that thoſe only are able to Reform an Error, who are ſo, to Underſtand whatever can be ſaid to prove it one. And ſuch, though (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) few in number, are not therefore leſs worthy our beſt ſervice.</p>
            <p>For every Learned perſon is a Publik one, and may be reckoned for as many as his Example or Diſcourſes may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: Nor can this Holy Office ever be reſtored to its long loſt obſervance, but by Their conduct who are guides to the people.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. THIS therefore is the ſum of my account. I ſee the <hi>Holy Communion</hi> ly under the unhappineſs of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s <hi>Fleece,</hi> denyed the bleſſing of Reſtoration, which all other Offices of our Worſhip enjoy: The moſt Pious and Prudent complain, not only in relation to the Sacrament it ſelf, but to thoſe good ends which it was deſigned to ſerve, and which wither for want of it. Thoſe who labor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, do Well, but not Enough. I have long expected that ſome better hand would proportion the Remedy to the Need: But finding thoſe Hopes diſappointed, and the Evil unabated, can no longer forbid my ſelf, to undertake a Work ſo neceſſary; wherein though I be obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with every underſtanding, yet am I rather to leave Many Vulgar Readers Ignorant, than One Learned one Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convinced, and therefor muſt not balk any thing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb facs="tcp:59001:22"/> difficult to be underſtood, if it have force anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>And if I appear ſingular in any my Poſitions, That alſo muſt be imputed to the ſingularity of my Task. I muſt dig deeper than others have done, prove what they have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, diſprove what they have connived at, ſearch the bottom of thoſe Expreſſions, whoſe Surface they have built upon: and ſo ſtate the whole, that every Practical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, eſpecially thoſe neceſſary ones above-mentioned, may be ſatisfied both fully and convincingly.</p>
            <p>We are to travel antiquated ways, over-grown not only with Weeds which hide every path, but Briars and Thorns which incumber them; not only with the Forgetfulneſs, but Prejudices of Many Generations; which to grub up, will require both ſtrength and labor, learning and care.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some Learning will be requiſite, but not much. We ſhall not need capt Fathers, or Councils, or School-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tumble our Books, or torment our Brains, to reconcile One Author with Another, or the Same with Himſelf. There is but one only Text which at all ſpeaks to the matter; and a little Logick, with ſufficient Care, will diſcover its meaning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But as much Care as you pleaſe. For I profeſs to fear any Learned Readers Haſt, more than his Rigor: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for I intreat and provoke him, to view and review, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and croſs-examine, ſift and ſearch every clauſe in this whole Diſſertation, and ſpare me not, if he find any one inconſiſtent with any other, either in This Work, or the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, or other Scripture, or with any other authentick Evidence, or any other rule of Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>I very well know what appearances my fundamental no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices will make to the firſt glance: They will ſeem extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, and perhaps ridiculouſly contemptible, bicauſe not only far out of the Rode. but ſhort of thoſe awful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions that we have growen up in toward the <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:</hi> Yet am I fully perſwaded, that the more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:59001:23"/> they are examined, the more will they appear, not only Suitable and Serviceable, but abſolutely Neceſſary to a clear underſtanding of our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and our own duty.</p>
            <p>And were I miſtaken and confuted in any collateral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, yea in almoſt all, yet if any One evidence remain unanſwered; That One muſt not ſuffer for the defects of its fellows, but claim ſuch ſubmiſſion as is due to its (however ſingle) power.</p>
            <p>I therefor pray my capable Reader, by all the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned and all other concerned Intereſts, For the Lords, the Churches, his Own and Others Souls ſakes: if he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues the Power of Godlineſs much decayed, the publick Peace much endangered, or <hi>this Holy Sacrament</hi> (the great promoter of both) much neglected: By all that ought to be dear to Chriſtians or Men, I pray him to be as ſevere, but withal as impartial, in examining what is here offered, as the dignity of the Subject, and the neglect it ſuffereth both from Doctors and People, require; and rhen to put That ſentence in execution which he ſo finds to be juſt.</p>
            <p>That I may not only exhort, but provoke you, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prevent an Objection ſuppoſing it unpracticable. I tell you, what our Lord ſaid in another caſe <hi>[The very ſtones will cry out]</hi> is in a ſort verified in this.</p>
            <p>When the defection of our Nation is almoſt as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as was that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s days; and thoſe to whom it properly belongs, neglect the redreſs; to the ſhame of us Prieſts, yea of us Men; but to the honor of the weaker Sex, and more tempted Quality, in a place promiſing as little as the condition of the perſons; as if Piety wrought by <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> a number of noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, emulating the Primitive Chriſtians, as in other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Devotion, ſo in This alſo, have combined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their ſuitably pious Miniſters in a Holy Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, paying our <hi>Lords day,</hi> his <hi>Supper,</hi> and his <hi>Poor,</hi> their joint rights, by celebrating the Holy Communion, with
<pb facs="tcp:59001:23"/> its Offertory at leaſt every Sunday. Wherein probably they deſign not barely to Perform, but to Exceed the utmoſt Obligations of ſtrict Duty, and by That very error ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, deſerve the applauſe of doing <hi>things that are more excellent:</hi> Yet leaving them the honor due to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good Intentions, I muſt rob them of the glory of ſupererogating in the performance, by proving that they hardly <hi>do all that is commanded them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which ſince I cannot do with any reaſonable hope or conſiderable ſucceſs, but by convincing the Learned; nor that, but by carefully tracing the Apoſtles diſcourſe through its various turnings, which will require more Care than learning, as well in Reader as Wrirer; leſt thoſe who are either unable or unwilling to undergo that task, ſhould by the obſcurity or craggineſs of the Entrance, be tempted to lay aſide the Whole; I was willing to have taken ſuch a method, as by the planeneſs of the firſt part of the way, might have invited them to hold throgh the reſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever uneaſie.</p>
            <p>For to trace a Story, is much eaſier and pleaſanter than to trace an Argument: And I thought it very probable, that upon view of the Practice of Chriſt's Church in its beſt Ages, every inquiſitive perſon would be willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, upon what ground That Practice was built: which finding to be no other but the Apoſtles reproof of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> he would think it worth his labor, both to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and dig that ground, ſo to diſcover, both how the Building was ſupported by it, and how it ſelf alſo was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; and ſince he could not fail to diſcover, that the Argument was built upon our Lords mind in his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with manifeſt indications, that the Inſtitution it ſelf was alſo grounded upon ſomthing antecedent: This doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs muſt invite him to dig on, till he could diſcover That Somthing which lay at the bottom of all as the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>But finding that This method, however more proper to
<pb facs="tcp:59001:24"/> Invite the Reader, was leſs ſo to Convince him: I choſe to proceed in the ſame order as the ſubject it ſelf hath do'n<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by building upward. Firſt therefore I have opened the Ground, then ſhewed how our Lords Inſtitution was built upon That Ground; then how the Apoſtles Argument was built upon That Inſtitution: and laſtly, how the Churches practice conformed to That Argument: and ſo we may moſt clearly underſtand how far our ſelves are concerned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to That Practice.</p>
            <p>And now to make what recompenſe I can for the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which this procedure may caſt upon the Reader, I know no better way than to advertiſe him, That if he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can not or will not take the pains to hunt after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Argument, he may paſs over the firſt and more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom part of this Diſcourſe, beginning at the fifth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the ſecond Part; wherein I hope he will find ſuch ſatisfaction, as may in a good meaſure deliver him from his miſapprehenſions, and encourage as well as oblige him, to the performance of his Duty, which is the aim of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; but not ſo completely attained without a full underſtanding both of our Lords and the Apoſtles meaſures whereon they built, the one his Inſtitution, and the other his Diſſertation; and himſelf (if he will do it regularly) muſt build his knowledge and practice.</p>
            <p>For without ſuch a diſcovery of the firſt Foundation, he may perhaps be ſufficiently Perſwaded, but not fully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; whereof the Former may ſatisfie a Learner, but the Later is neceſſary for a Teacher; to which better Quality I therefore offer the following Reſearches, becauſe without Their conviction firſt, and then endeavors, the ſo General Error can never be cured.</p>

For as he ſhall reſcue the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> from ſtifling under a heap of humane Inventions, ſo ſhall he the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> from ſuffering under the ſcandal of inſufficiency, in a ſubject neceſſary to be known.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59001:25"/>
               <p>That This is ſuch a Subject, we ſhall find hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if we obſerve with what Care our Lord recommended it, and upon what Reaſons.</p>
               <p>This we ſhall hereafter find occaſion to conſider more fully. At preſent we ſhall reſt in the concurrent agreement of All Ages and Nations Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But though All ages agree in This, that it is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with our beſt ſervices; yet do the Laſt much differ from the Firſt in the manner of payment.</p>
               <p>The Primitive, ſo certainly made it the Principal part of All their publik Worſhip, that they gave it the honor to denominate the Whole: they conſecrated a Weekly day to it, bicauſe (during the power of the Jews) they could nor celebrate it on their Sabbath: they imbraced it as the inſtrument of their Communion, both with Chriſt and one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Later departed from This conſtancy, not out of Neglect, but Reverence; wherewith they have ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Over-honored, that thereby we have Loſt both It, and its Benefits: Yea, which is worſe, perverted it to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of That Communion of Love among our ſelves, which it promoted, while conſtantly celebrated among better Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For when Neceſſity cried to the Officers of Chriſts Church to reſcue this <hi>Holy Supper</hi> from the Profanation it then ſuffered, by the licentiouſneſs of the Greeks, they imployed all their powers to put it in the greateſt Diſtance from any ſuch contemt.</p>
               <p>They thought they could not ſpeak too much, or ſoar too high: They were not ſatisfied with what the Scripture hath Said, nor what Reaſon can Apprehend; but laying aſide their Rule, differ as much among Themſelves as from It.</p>
               <p>HENCE is it, that nothing hath be'n Said by any One, which hath not be'n Denied with equal confidence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59001:25"/> by Others. There are not ſo many Words in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, as Differences of judgment. Philoſophers had not ſo many Opinions concerning Mans chief happineſs, as Divines have concerning this chief office of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So we ſomtimes eſpy</hi> (it is the conceit of an excellent perſon) <hi>a bright cloud formed into an irregular figure; when it is obſerved by unskilful and fantaſtick Travellers, it looks like a Centaur to ſome, and a Caſtel to others; ſome tell that they ſaw an Army with banners, and it ſignifies War; but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other wiſer then his fellows, ſays it looks for all the world like a flock of Sheep, and foretels plenty; and all the while it is nothing but a ſhining Cloud, by its own mobility and the activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a wind, caſt into a contingent and inartificial ſhape: So it is in this great myſtery of our Religion, in which ſome eſpy ſtrange things, which God intended not, and others ſee not what God hath plainly told,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And would to God it were no worſe: But 'tis no ſuch jeſting mater. For as Opinions are Multiplied without Number, ſo are they Valued without Meſure; and what is ſpoken without Reaſon, is impoſed without Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>No Province in Religion is ſo peſtered with Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among the Scholaſtical, Myſteries among the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative, Scruples among the Practik; none proſecuted with greater heat and leſs ſatisfaction: Every ones zele for his Opinion taking its meſure (or unmeſurableneſs rather) from his value for the Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">II. WERE there no other Diſputes but ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the precarious Myſteries, which have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parent, but fanciful mens Inventions; nor no other Nurſe, but Curioſity in niceties not practical; however great the Troubl might be, the Scandal would be litle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Scripture, which might with <hi>Gallio,</hi> refuſe <hi>to be judge of ſuch matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the Queſtion is as Important, as the Subject
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59001:26"/> is Venerable; when it pretends not to gratifie Curioſity, but to ſatisfie Conſcience; and that, not in ſome Inferior, but the Capital, Critical duty: That our Lord and All his Churches ſhould value it ſo High, and yet the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture treat it ſo Slightly, is a Myſtery as Great and as Fals, as any among the multitude impoſed upon it.</p>
               <p>How then ſhall we eſcape the Scandalous Dilemma? Either the Scriprure cannot be Sufficient, if defective in ſo Capital a ſubject; or the Inſtitution muſt not be ſo Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, if the great Author both of it and the Scriprure did not think it worthy to be Legibly written.</p>
               <p>Wer not the Recrimination more obvious than the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, did not Tradition leave the Romaniſts under as great uncertainty in theſe great queſtions, as the Scriptures do us, they would undoubtedly ſo Urge, that we ſhould not be able to Anſwer the Scandal.</p>
               <p>But to Recriminate is a poor juſtification. Or if the Papiſts be to be anſwered, What ſay we to the Jews? If the Lord took off the <hi>vele from</hi> Moſes<hi>'s face,</hi> and put a thicker on his Own, How ſhall the Light of the Goſpel triumph over the Obſcurity of the Law? Not all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the <hi>Moſaik Law</hi> put together, will thicken to ſo opake a mask, as this One.</p>
               <p>They hid indeed the Significance, but not the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law. The vele was upon their Hearts, but not upon their Eyes.</p>
               <p>They ſaw not the full meaning of Circumciſion, but they did the Certain Time wherein they were to celebrate it: They underſtood not the utmoſt ſignification of the <hi>Paſeal Rite,</hi> yet were they ſure How often, and in what Day they were to Sacrifice and eat the Lamb. But This great office is obſcure even in its Obligations. We as litle know what we are to Do, as the Jews did what they were to Believe.</p>
               <p>How then ſhall we juſtifie the Scripture in point of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency againſt the Papiſts, or in point of Clearneſs againſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59001:26"/> the Jews, without reneguing the Honor due to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>
               <p>We find a kind of Compoſition offered by one of our greateſt Aſſertors, both of the Sufficiency of the Scripture and Dignity of the Sacrament: <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not much opened in the writings of the New Teſtament, but ſtill left in its myſterious nature; it is too much untwiſted and nicely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the writings of the Doctors, and by them made more myſterious: and like a Doctrine of Philoſophy, made intricate and difficult by the aperture and diſſolution of diſtinctions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> hath left it a Shining cloud, and the Doctors reaſonings varied it into Contingent ſhapes; (as he expreſſeth it) what can we ſay, but either there is no need to unvele the Myſtery, and then the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be degraded from its Dignity, as not Worthy to be underſtood or celebrated, or we muſt have ſome better Oracle to fix its ſignification, and ſince other Doctors make it more Intricate, where can we hope to find ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but from the Infallible Chair?</p>
               <p>This moſt excellent Author hath written ſo Much and ſo Well, both for the Scripture and the Sacrament, that I cannot doubt him willing to ſacrifice This One aſſertion to Their Reconciliation; which alſo is as worthy our labor, as the advancement of Either in prejudice of the Other.</p>
               <p>AND why ſhould we not improve the offer now made us? wholely free the New Teſtament from Myſteriouſneſs, and lay the whole blame upon the Doctors, as having not encreaſed only, but firſt cauſed the entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>He that ſhall do this and Prove it true, if he appear Rude toward ſo many Reverend Perſons, may well hope to be juſtified by the Neceſſity: And if he further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not only the Cauſe of the entanglement, but the way to clear it; if he take the right Thred, and ſo draw it as to Untwiſt the whole, without leaving any Knot untied,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59001:27"/> he may deſerve no worſe uſage than a Child, that with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Luck than Art, hath diſentangled a skein of Silk, which his Parent had ſnarled and could not unwind.</p>
               <p>The former half of this ſo juſtifiable work, will not require much time or labor. It is but obſerving (and it is obvios to the firſt glance) what is the regular way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the mind of any Author; and we ſhall ſoon find how Generally, how Groſly, and how Miſchievoſly it hath be'n forſaken in this Subject.</p>
               <p>If we look upon the Anatomiſt diſſecting a dead Body, we may thence learn how we are to examine a Diſcourſe. The Artiſt, who aims at no other deſign but to trace the ways of life, firſt takes a General vieu of the whole Body, and then a Particular one of every Member, examins the Texture of every Particle, the mutual Aſpect of each to other, and the joint Uſefulneſs of All to the life: But the Butcher, who aims at nothing but his Profit, chops off ſuch members as may beſt advance it, makes of Them the moſt he can, leaving the Bowels as inconſiderable, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to himſelf, thogh moſt ſerviceable to the life.</p>
               <p>Can I help it, if truth oblige me to ſay, the Doctors have handled thoſe parts of Scripture which relate to <hi>This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not like Anatomiſts, but like Butchers? that they cut off ſuch a Particular clauſe, as they think moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for their own preconceved Opinion, treat it as a diſtinct Body by it ſelf, regard not its Office in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it ought to ſerve, but make the utmoſt they can of that One, without reſpect to all the Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In matter of Fact, nothing is rude that is true: I need not therefore ſtand upon manners, but boldly ſay, that the Doctors on both ſides have ſo Treated, as if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to Abuſe the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, and our Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. For the Papiſts cut the Inſtitution alongſt, and lay aſide One Side; our Own Divines cut the Apoſtles Comment athwart, laying aſide the Upper half.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59001:27"/>IV. 1. <hi>THE Papiſts, that they may maintene their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Tranſubſtantiation, cut our Lords Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Sides, make all poſſible advantage of That which ſeems moſt Serviceable, and lay by the Other as wors than Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For whereas the Elements are two, they make all poſſible advantage of the Bread. This they ſay muſt be the Lords Body in the literal ſenſe, bicauſe he hath categorically ſaid ſo; and ſince it is as eaſie for him to Do it as to Say it, there is no Neceſſity, and therefor no Reaſon, why we ſhould quit the moſt Proper ſenſe. For Reaſon muſt not be balanced againſt Faith. This muſt believe the Thing, though That cannot comprehend the Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Wine all this while is laid aſide as Unſerviceable; All the regard paid it is but as an Attendent; It is concluded, that ſince the Bread is the Lords Body, the Wine muſt needs be his Blood, whether our Lord have ſaid any thing at all, or any thing to the contrary concerning it, or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet our Lord honored the Wine, No Leſs; and the Apoſtle, More, than the Bread. There are no Valves that hinder the Reflux; but we may with the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Evidence, interpret That by This, as This by That.</p>
               <p>Now (if we believe the Apoſtle) Our Lord ſaid not of the Wine <hi>[This is my Blood]</hi> but <hi>[This Cup is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in my Blood.]</hi> And the literal ſenſe ſaith not more plainly of the Bread <hi>[This is my natural Body]</hi> than it ſaith of the Wine <hi>[This is NOT my natural Blood.]</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore They may argue Poſitively, That the Wine muſt be our Lords Blood, bicauſe the Bread is his Body; we may upon the ſame evidence argue Negatively, The <hi>Bread is Not his Body,</hi> but only the <hi>New Teſtament in his Body;</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Wine is Not his Blood,</hi> but only the <hi>New Teſtament in his Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59001:28"/>
               <p>With the favor therefore of our better Champions, I conceive we ought to learn, as of the Adder, ſo of the Papiſt, to direct our blow to That part, they are ſo careful to fence, and reſtore the Cup to its due office. Poſſibly they have denyed it its right in the Peoples celebration, out of pique for the ill office it is ſo apt to do to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved doctrine: let us reſtore it to Both its Rights, its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor due by our Lords Inſtitution, and its power of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation due by the Laws of Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>We cannot more effectually ſilence their importunity for the literal ſenſe, than by claiming it. They who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Senſe and Reaſon, worthy to be ballanced againſt the Letter, cannot deny One Element to be ſo againſt the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What therefore they have put aſunder, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Lord to have joined together, we cannot but know our ſelves obliged to Receive both in the ſame ſenſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Literal or Myſtical.</p>
               <p>If Both are to be Myſtically underſtood, the querel is ended between us; If Literally, we make a new one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Elements. If One muſt comply, he that hath One grain of it, will grant, that Reaſon muſt turn the ſcale on that ſide where it ſhall be found. Thoſe who deny it weight enough to preponderate the the Literal ſenſe, cannot deny it ſufficient to turn Aequilibrate Scales.</p>
               <p>So that the defect lyeth not in the Scripture, but the Doctors; whoſe partiality to One ſide above the Other, hath made a difficulty, which an equal regard to Both ſides would have prevented.</p>
               <p>And it is yet further conſiderable, that they carry the ſame Partiality toward that ſide they ſo favor. For as our Lords Inſtitution hath two equal parts, ſo hath their favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Propoſition <hi>[This is my Body.]</hi> And whereas the Laws of Reaſoning require we ſhould firſt underſtand the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and then the Predicate; the Former they wholely lay aſide, and employ all their endeavors upon the Later; which I might now inſiſt upon, as another Butcherly abuſe,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59001:28"/> but I ſhall hereafter meet another occaſion to call it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and therefore haſten to what more nearly concerns our preſent biſineſs; wherein if I ſhould prefer reverence to perſons, however worthy, above the Truth I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſerve, I ought to be branded with a worſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter than that of Irreverence to my betters, which I expect to be accuſed of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our own Divines therefore I cannot avoid impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as guilty of the ſame Partiality. To cut the Higher part from the Lower, is Another, but no leſs irregular way of diſſection, eſpecially when the Lower depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the influence of the Higher, for all its Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>That the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> dependeth as a concluſion upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is manifeſt by the illative <hi>[Wherefore]</hi> From the Forgoing diſcourſe therefore ought all the Following to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its Life and Power. Yet who is there that takes any notice of Thoſe Premiſes or their Influence? Doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one paſs by All the reſt, and begin his endeavors at the Concluſion?</p>
               <p>And as if we gloried in varying our irregularities into all poſſible ſhapes. We take the quite contrary way with the next (the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) verſe; for whereas the Apoſtle there makes the Former half the harbinger of the Later, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy All our care about That, and wholely neglect This, which That is to ſerve.</p>
               <p>Yea, as if it were a ſmall matter to Neglect; we Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand the expreſs Injunction, and ſo daſh One Precept againſt Another. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>and ſo let him eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>[Let a man examine himſelf]</hi> (ſay we) with all poſſible caution, and ſo let him beware that <hi>he eat Not that Bread Nor drink of that Cup,</hi> if he find himſelf Unworthy, whatever the Apoſtle have ſaid to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59001:29"/>V. BUT it is eaſier to find faults than to amend them, and I promiſed not only to ſhew the cauſe of the embarra's, but the way out; which ſure muſt be by the ſame Light, and by contrary ſteps. If we Therefor miſs the Apoſtles tru meaning, bicauſe we miſs the tru way to trace it; then muſt we needs be obliged to ſearch after it in that ſame way, which we have ſo diſcovered to be the Right and Forſaken one.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore carefully Anatomiſe the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Firſt obſerve the Deſign, then the great Limbs, then the leaſt Particles, Their proper Textures, their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aſpects, their joint Serviceableneſs to That Deſign, which animates them All to its own Uſe.</p>
               <p>But as in Dead bodies (eſpecially ſuch as have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time layen ſo) many D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cts diſappear, which during life were as Viſible as Neceſſary; and the Artiſt many times is led by mere Reaſon, grounded upon conſent of parts, to Find out if poſſible; otherwiſe, to Suppoſe thoſe ſecret channels whereof he finds no other evidence but neceſſity: So are there in This Diſcourſe very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Suppoſitions, which though they were ſufficiently evident when the Apoſtle wrote, and will ever be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the circulation of his Argument; yet by Length of time, and Forgetfulneſs (if not worſe) of thoſe who ſhould have kept them open, are now ſo loſt, that without careful Probing they are not diſcoverable.</p>
               <p>Two ſuch Suppoſitions I ſhall now take upon Truſt, pawning all my labor to pay good Evidence for them, in a more proper Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Churches of Chriſt at That time celebrated All their Religious meetings with Feſts:</hi> (This is more then half proved by the very firſt glance upon the Text.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That in All their Church Feſts, they honored ſome Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Bread and Cup with Special ceremonies;</hi> the Cup ever cloſing the Feſt: This will require a fuller Examination.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59001:29"/>
               <p>Upon theſe two Suppoſitions, the Apoſtles Argument (otherwiſe unintelligible) and All his Expreſſions (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome muſt be otherwiſe impertinent) will appear moſt Clear, Rational and Unanſwerable.</p>
               <p>By their help therefore I ſhall make a duble diſſection; of the Words, by a Paraphraſe; and of the Argument, by an Analyſis.</p>

                           <p>If your debauchery be ſuch, that you cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear drunkenneſs, it were leſs intolerable to practiſe it in private in your own houſes, than thus impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affront the whole Church, and inſult over them who have neither houſes nor ſuch plentiful proviſions. I ſaid indeed, <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>I praiſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59001:30"/> you that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as I delivered them to you.</hi> But in this, which is an Ordinance of the firſt Magnitude, I muſt make an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                           <p>For this Tradition I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not, as I did the reſt, from my fellow Apoſtles, but from the Lord Jeſus himſelf: and ſince you ſeem ether to have forgotten or miſtaken it, I again repete it, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus in the ſame night wherein he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed</hi> (being a Feſtival one) <hi>took Bread,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>After that ſame Feſtival manner alſo, he took the cloſing Cup, in its proper time, <hi>viz.</hi> after Supper, ſaying, <hi>As often as ye drink this Cup,</hi> in this manner, do it <hi>in remembrance of me,</hi> and not as you have hitherto do'n it.</p>
                           <p>For by this Inſtitution, This Bread and This Cup is ſo advanced above its former dignity, that it is conſecrated to a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of our Lords death; and as ſuch is to be honored, and that to the end of the world; ſo that neither you, nor any other Chriſtian Church, ſhall ever be at liberty to uſe it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, this bread and cup are now no longer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59001:30"/> your own, but the Lords; and who ever uſeth them in a manner unworthy of that Relation, is guilty not only of Intemperance, but Sacrilege; as abuſing not common Bread and Wine, but the thereby repreſented Body and Blood of the Lord.</p>
                           <p>But remember that it is the proper character of a Man to examin his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Do ſo in This, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you do, and act ſutably to your rule.

                           <p>For he that doth it in a manner unſuitable to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, provoketh our Lord to anger; as leveling His Fleſh with that of a Beaſt, and His Blood with that of a Grape; putting no difference, but treating the one in the ſame rude manner as he doth the other.</p>

               <p>By this Paraphraſe well underſtood and duly heeded, we ſhall not fail of the Apoſtles meaning in the whole and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Particle; provided we handle them regularly, which I ſhall now do by a Logical Analyſis of the Argument.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. BY the Rules of Reaſoning, we muſt Firſt conſider the Concluſion intended to be proved, and Then the Media imployed to that End; meſuring Theſe by their ſerviceableneſs to That.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion, is the charge of Profaneneſs in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> relating to our <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> This animates, and This muſt interpret every word, and therefore requires to be it's ſelf moſt carefully heeded: And one might think a litle heed ſufficient, ſince it ſeems impoſſible either to Overlook or Miſtake it.</p>
               <p>He doth not only plainly lay it down, but thrice incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it. And ſince in every propoſition the Quantity is highly conſiderable, we muſt carefully obſerve, that he doth not accuſe them as guilty of miſdemeanors in Some more than Other meetings, but in All alike.</p>
               <p>Had he charged them as guilty in Some ſpecial meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wherein the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was more eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, we had then underſtood that it was not concerned in All aſſemblies as ſuch: Or had he charged them as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> in All meetings, without heeding whether it were concerned in them, or no; if in Thoſe meetings they were at liberty to have celebrated or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, they might excuſe themſelves by ſaying, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it not in thoſe particular ones.</p>
               <p>But becauſe they Never met in the Church without Feſting, and in All ſuch Feſts they were obliged by Chriſts command to celebrate his Own; he therefore blameth their Feſts Univerſally, and that in ſuch language, that thrice varying the Phraſe, he ſtill further cleareth his meaning.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59001:31"/>
               <p>Verſe 17. <hi>Your coming together is not for the better, but for the worſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>coming together</hi> Indefinitly, if it be not plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough equivalent to an Vniverſal, is more clearly made ſo by <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>When you come together in the Church,</hi> where the more general <hi>[coming together]</hi> is ſo appropriated to the <hi>[Church]</hi> that the indefinite <hi>[when]</hi> muſt be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to <hi>whenſoever,</hi> as yet more plainly appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>When you come together into one place, it is not to eat the Lords Supper.</hi> This is the extract of the whole charge, That when they <hi>came together</hi> into That holy place which was ſet apart for Gods worſhip, they ſo behaved themſelves, that what they did, could not be taken for the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A charge which now adays we ſhould not decline; and why ſhould the <hi>Corinthians</hi> more than we? We acknowledg (might they not ſay?) yea, we plead it. We cannot be ſaid to <hi>Eat the Lords Supper:</hi> and what then? therefore we cannot be ſaid to Profane it.</p>
               <p>This might have be'n an evaſion as Effectual as Obvios, if the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> were not concerned in Thoſe very ſame meetings, which he ſo Deſcribed and Reproved: <hi>i. e.</hi> in All.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the ſum of his Charge, and it muſt be the Deſign of his Reaſoning, to prevent any evaſion; not to be do'n, but by proving, That in All their meetings the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was Therefore Abuſed, becauſe it was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them All.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider by what <hi>Media</hi> he proveth it.</p>
               <p>At the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> he beginneth his evidence: appealing to our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> explained by a Revelation. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital whereof it is moſt conſiderable, that in reporting the conſecration of the Cup, he addeth words not mentioned by any of the Evangeliſts; nor by himſelf, in That of the Bread. For none of Them ſay, that our Lord ſaid of the Cup <hi>[Do this as often as you drink it]</hi> nor doth Himſelf ſay that our Lord ſaid of the Bread <hi>[Do this as often as ye eat
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59001:32"/> it.]</hi> The Reaſon of this difference we ſhall have a fitter time to enquire hereafter.</p>
               <p>At Preſent we muſt not neglect to obſerve, That as he is very careful thus to Inſert theſe words; ſo is he, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to Reſume them, and ſettle them as the Foundation of his whole Argument. For upon this Suppoſition, that our Lord preferred <hi>This Bread and This Cup</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed in All Church-meetings, to ſuch an Office, that whether they Conſidered it or no, yea whether they Would or no, it muſt <hi>ſet forth his death;</hi> Then (and not otherwiſe) will All his Inferences follow, that the abuſe of <hi>[This bread and This eup]</hi> reach <hi>That body and blood,</hi> which they ſo repreſent.</p>
               <p>And leſt This ſhould fright them, not only from the Abuſe, but the Uſe too, of <hi>[This bread and This cup]</hi> to prevent ſo great an inconvenience, he is careful to warn them, that it is no leſs crime to <hi>diſobey our Lords Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> than to <hi>Profane his Supper:</hi> They muſt firſt examin themſelves to prevent the One, and then <hi>[Eat this bread and drink this cup]</hi> to avoid the Other. And having thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the duty, both in the Thing and the Manner, he binds it by Threatnings to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the great Limbs of this Body, This the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Argument; Thus doth it anſwer his own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, <hi>The body is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint ſupplieth.</hi> Not one joint too little, or too much; not One looſe Expreſſion, not One word Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or Unſerviceable; every part hath its mutual conſent with every other part, and its office of Serviceableneſs to the whole, which alſo is complete, without any the leaſt defect.</p>
               <p>His Charge made good in its whole Latitude. The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> convicted, All Evaſions barred, The Crime diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, rhe Danger diſcovered, the Duty inforced, the only Safe way ſet forth, and the Fear of deſerting it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>

               <p>And becauſe ſome require not only Logik force, but Logik form too; This is the formal Proceſs of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>

               <p>The Propoſition (which alone needeth it) he proveth by words purpoſely inſerted in his recital of our Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. and reſumed, <hi>ver.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>As often as you come together in the Church, you eat this bread and drink this cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by aſſiſtance of this Aſſumption, the whole is made unanſwerable.</p>
               <p>This fundamental Aſſumption then Deſerveth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth our utmoſt care. I ſhall therefore moſt diligently obſerve it; And for greater clearneſs, ſhall tranſpoſe the Apoſtles words, reading them Thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This cup as often as you drink, do it in remembrance of Me.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>And having thus ſtated our obligation, by examining the Apoſtles diſcourſe, I ſhall examine what is ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by our late Divines, who not heeding the Standard, and meſuring the duty by a (good, but) unfit one, have defeated both our Lords deſign and their own too.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>OUR Lord, after his laſt Supper, treated Bread and Wine with ſuch kindneſs, as at another time he did little Children: <hi>He took them up, laid his hands upon them, and bleſſed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with This great difference, that of Thoſe he favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Whole kind: <hi>Suffer</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>[little children] to come to me. [Little children]</hi> indefinitely, <hi>i. e. Any little children</hi> whatſoever; and gave a Reaſon, comprehenſive as the Precept, For of <hi>ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas Here, he preferreth not Bread and Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, nor ſpeaketh a word of their Fitneſs for the honor; recommendeth not either of them as Such, but as This; <hi>i. e.</hi> Not the whole Genus, nor any Other Species, but only This, <hi>i. e.</hi> This ſingularly Proper cup.</p>
               <p>So great a difference in his Expreſſion, muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a ſuitable difference in his Intention.</p>
               <p>In the Former caſe; his Words plainly declare his meaning, That as often as Any parents, or other friends,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59001:33"/> deſired to bring Any Children to him for his bleſſing, his Diſciples ſhould admit them, whoever they wer. And had he now meant as Univerſally of Bread and Wine, as then he did of Children; he Eaſily Might, and therefor Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would have declared ſuch a parallel Intention, with a parallel Expreſſion, ſaying, As often as you deſire to ſet forth my death by a viſibl repreſentative, do it with Bread and Wine; for ſuch viands ar proper to That end.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſay he Might, and therefore Would have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his meaning, if he had meant no more; bicauſe Thus it would have be'n beſt underſtood. For (as reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) it was his conſtant Practice to deliver his Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal precepts in the cleareſt ſtile, that the dulleſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the moſt illiterate Fiſherman, might underſtand his duty.</p>
               <p n="2">II. IN the Myſteries of the Kingdom indeed, eſpecially ſuch as might have temted his (yet) carnal followers to forſake him, he Hinted, and Intimated more than he thought fit to Expreſs: and he gave his reaſon, <hi>I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to ſay to you, but you cannot bear them now.</hi> He therefore ſpake only ſo much as might ſerv to prepare them for that <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> which as it brought all his Sayings to their Memories, and all his Inſtitutions to their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; ſo did it <hi>indue them with power from on high,</hi> to bear ſuch truths, as were then too Big for their narrow Capacities, or too Heavy for their ſenſual Affections.</p>
               <p>Now, this is a Practical Precept, Therefore Injoined, that it may be Performed; and for that reaſon oght ſo to be Expreſſed, that it may be clearly Underſtood, eſpecially in ſuch Neceſſary points as are to be Meſures of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as it is a Practical precept, ſo it is a Poſitive one too. And ſuch (above all other) require the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and Cleareſt declaration of the Authors meaning:</p>
               <p>For Precepts Moral, if they be leſs clearly delivered,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59001:34"/> may receve further light from the candle of the Lord, which ſhines in every mans Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But Precepts Poſitive, having no other Meſur, but the mere Will of the Law-maker, can have no other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter but his Words, which therefor need be as Clear, as his intentions to be obeyed can be Real.</p>
               <p>Which in This caſe we cannot doubt them to be, ſince it is appropriate to his own Perſonal honor, and favored with many expreſſions of his eſteem.</p>
               <p>If ever therefore we muſt meſure our Lords Mind by his Words, it muſt be Now: and Conſequently, Now muſt we moſt carefully examin the Proper ſenſe of Every word, by ſuch teſts as are owned by all mankind.</p>
               <p n="3">III. AND among his Words this Particle [THIS] as it hath the firſt Place, ſo hath it a principal Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Our Lord made it the <hi>head ſtone of the corner,</hi> thogh the <hi>bilders have rejected it, and made it a ſtone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James</hi> ſaid of the Toung, may be applied to THIS Particle. It is very litle in Bulk, but very great in Power: and that Power it exerciſeth in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner too.</p>
               <p>The Bridle determins the motion of the otherwiſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Horſe; and the Helm, That of the otherwiſe flot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ship; and THIS, the otherwiſe Undermined object.</p>
               <p>If we go on with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>James,</hi> and complain of it's <hi>ſetting on fire the courſe of nature,</hi> the unhappy ſentence may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more gilty than Any: But our THIS is ſo far from the Incendiary, that had not it's help be'n refuſed, it wold either have Prevented or Quenched the flames.</p>
               <p>For had the Doctors imploy'd ſome of That care in duly Stateing the power of the word [THIS] which they have worſe than loſt upon Exalting that of the word BODY; the <hi>Cup of bleſſing</hi> could never have ſpent (as it hath do'n) more blood of Chriſtians than of the Grape.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:59001:34"/>
               <p>But thoſe who reſolved to Deify the word BODY, muſt Sacrifice to it our word THIS: That they might deſtroy the principles of Natural Philoſophy, they muſt begin with thoſe of Grammar and Logick, which concur to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our Special regard to the neglected Particle.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. GRAMMAR tells us, that it is a <hi>Pronoun Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrative.</hi> As an <hi>Adjective,</hi> it cannot ſtand without a <hi>Subſtantive:</hi> and as a <hi>Demonſtrative,</hi> it muſt have a proper Object to point at.</p>
               <p>And Logik ſaith the Same, if we look upon it as a Simple word; and More, if we look upon it as part of a <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we look upon it as a Single word, Logik calleth it <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>categorical,</hi> which is another expreſſion of the ſame office which Grammar aſcribeth to it. It ſo points at ſome Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar object, as to change the <hi>Vagum</hi> into <hi>Determinatum,</hi> and put as much difference between This Cup, and Any cup, as there is between <hi>Hic homo</hi> and <hi>Quidam;</hi> which is no leſs than what the Proper name can add to the Common nature. For if <hi>Peter</hi> be pointed at, and called This man, he is thereby as much diſtinguiſhed from all other men, as if he were named.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If it be thought ſufficient that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween THIS and other bread, as ſoon as it is prepared for Conſecration.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, We ar not yet com'n ſo far. We are not now enquiring into the Conſequence of the Action, but into the Meaning of the Inſtitution; which was the Cauſ, of the (then futur) Action,</p>
               <p>We know it to be no Common Bread, when it is Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate (or about to be ſo) from Common uſe: but we wold alſo know whether it wer not diſtinguiſhed from Common bread, before the Inſtitution required us ſo to Separate it: whether it had not ſome Praevios fitneſs above Any other Bread, which might prefer it before All orher, to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59001:35"/> wherewith our Lord honored it, in conſideration of That ſingular Praevios fitneſs.</p>
               <p>Now ſince our Lord pointed to it by the <hi>Demonſtrative</hi> THIS, before ever he had Conſecrated it, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it Singularly capable of the Office; either it muſt have ſome Praevious ſingularity, or the <hi>Demonſtrative</hi> muſt be vain, as having Nothing to demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>FOR Words are but Images of Thoghts: and as That Thoght muſt be vain which hath no Thing to anſwer it, ſo muſt That Word be, that is not anſwered by a Thoght: the One and the Other muſt be verified by ſome Idea.</p>
               <p>But of All words, the neceſſity lieth heavieſt upon THIS. Others muſt Signifie ſome proper object: This doth not only Signifie, but Point to it, and muſt be not only Vain, but Abuſive, if profeſſing to ſhew ſomthing, it have nothing to ſhew. This Prieſt muſt of neceſſity have ſomthing to offer.</p>
               <p>I here challenge Any one to ſhew me, in Any Author whatſoever, any one example wherein This <hi>Demonſtrative</hi> createth the firſt Difference, without any Praevios diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Object ſo to be pointed at: And 'till That can be do'n, we may very well receve our Lords word in the ſame Senſe, ſince it carrieth the ſame Sound, as it doth in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſtile.</p>
               <p>This (ſaid he of the Blood of ſprinkling) THIS <hi>is the blood of the Covenant:</hi> That Blood receved not All its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties from what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid or did: But it Firſt differed from All other blood, by its Proper circumſtances of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and <hi>Moſes</hi> finding it ſo Prediſpoſed, honored it with a ſingular Demonſtrative and Dignity.</p>
               <p>Our Lords ſtile is the very ſame, and plainly alludeth to the ſame form of Conſecration: <hi>This cup</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is the New Covenant,</hi> and therefore This blood of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; muſt (as well as that of the Old) have ſome Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vios ſingularities preceding the Propoſition, and Fitting it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59001:35"/> for the honor whereto, merely by reaſon of That fitneſs it was ſo preferred above All other.</p>
               <p>As we know what Honor it receved from the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo we muſt enquire what was the Singular fitneſs it broght to it: We are not yet com'n to the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, DO THIS, where the Demonſtrative following the Action, may derive a ſingularity from it: but we are yet in the porch, in the Declaration, [THIS is] <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to learn what THIS can ſignify, before any other word be ſpoken, which may change it to ſome other ſtate, than what belonged to it before.</p>
               <p n="5">V. HITHERTO we have looked upon it in its Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle capacity. Logik further conſidereth it as a Part, and the principal Part too, of a Propoſition. It is no leſs than the Subject, conſiderable Always as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereon the Praedicate is to be bilt; and Oftentimes as the Standard whereby its meaning is to be meſured.</p>
               <p>For the ſenſe of the Praedicate muſt ever be fitted to the capacity of the Subject: and if the ordinary ſignification appear too big or too little, the Inrerpreter muſt imitate the Prophet, who applied his <hi>Own Eyes, Hands</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> to the <hi>Childs;</hi> wherein he muſt derive his meſures from the Speakers mind, ſomtimes diſcoverable by common Reaſon, and ſomtimes by the Speakers annexed Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>E.

               <p>Our Lords ſtile is the ſame, at other times as well as now. And we may as reaſonably ſay, Our Lord was not a Man, but a Plant, becauſe he ſaid <hi>[I am the Vine]</hi> thogh he interpreted himſelf by adding <hi>[In Me ye bring forth fruit]</hi> Yea, not ſo much as a Living plant, becauſe he ſaid <hi>[I am the door]</hi> thogh he immediatly added <hi>[by me if any enter in, he ſhall be ſaved]</hi> As we may, that this is not Bread, becauſe he ſaid <hi>[This is my body]</hi> when he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly gloſſed upon the word, by adding <hi>[Do This in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the contrary, we are as much obliged to meſure This Propoſition by the annexed Limitation, as either of the Other; and ſo to confeſs, that This is no more our Lords Body, than himſelf was a Door, or <hi>Iſſachar</hi> an Aſs.</p>
               <p>Now if it be true, that the Praedicate muſt be thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the Subject; then, the leſs capable the Subject is, the leſs muſt we giv it of the Praedicate. If therefor Bread <hi>[as ſuch]</hi> cannot be underſtood to be our <hi>Lords body;</hi> Then perhaps [as THIS] it may carry ſuch diminiſhing characters, as may write it leſs capable.</p>
               <p>For This reaſon, it is probable that former Ages have be'n induſtriouſly ſilent concerning it, and for This reaſon is the enquiry neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Thogh This be a quite different queſtion, yet it is not unſerviceable, even toward our underſtanding the Other. It is one queſtion, which asketh what <hi>Jacob</hi> meant by the word Aſs? when he put it upon <hi>Iſſachar:</hi> and another to ask, which of his ſons it was whom he ſo ſtiled? So it is one thing to enquire what our Lord meant by the word [Body] when he ſaid of the Bread, <hi>This is my body:</hi> and another, to enquire what extraordinary Bread that was which he preferred to that dignity.</p>
               <p>THE Eunuchs firſt queſtion was Not concerning the Things to be ſuffered, but the Perſon that was to undergo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59001:36"/> them: He asked not what was meant by being <hi>led like a lamb to the ſlaughter,</hi> his <hi>judgment taken away in his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> or <hi>the obſcurity of his generation;</hi> But <hi>of whom ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Prophet this?</hi> And the ſame muſt be our method if we will underſtand our Lords Inſtitution. Before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what he meant by calling the bread his Body, we muſt ask of what bread ſpeaketh the Lord this?</p>
               <p>We may probably better underſtand [Into What] our Lord changed it, if we firſt know [From What.] Many Therefore underſtand not What they ſay, becauſe they know not Whereof, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. Many wold not have Spoken, Others would not have Believed, what All confeſs they cannot Underſtand, in the Praedicate of this unhappy Propoſition, if they had firſt underſtood its true Subject as they ought to have do'n.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our Lord ſpake only of that individual Bread and That individual Cup which he then diſtributed, ſo as to make Thoſe Individuals the adaequate Subject, as well of his permanent Inſtitution, as of That One Diſtribution, cannot be imagined; ſince Thoſe Individuals muſt periſh in the uſeing, but for ever live in ſuch ſucceſſors, as may be the Same in the General Nature of Bread and Wine, and in the Special circumſtances wherewith thoſe were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, even before their preferment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he ſpake of the Whole kind, Any Bread and Any Cup, we may not believe, both becauſe of the now mentioned difference of ſtile in This text, and That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Children: and becauſe ſuch a ſenſe would oblige us to Conſecrate All bread and All wine, ſeeing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative would have pointed to All alike. This ſenſe is as much too Wide as the former was too Narrow: yet ſome will have a yet Wider. For</p>
               <p n="4">4. They conceve that our Lord was ſo far from pointing to any determinate Bread, that he did not to any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Thing. But the <hi>Hoc</hi> muſt be taken Indeterminately,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59001:37"/> 
                  <hi>Hoc,</hi> i. e. <hi>Hoc aliquid,</hi> This Somthing. That they may deſtroy the nature of Bread, they begin with that of the Pronown.</p>
               <p>For whereas the Proper office of This Pronown, is to make the Object More determinate, by ſingling One out of Many, contracting the General to a Special or Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; This ſenſe will make it Leſs Determinate and More General: 'twill be ſo far from diſtinguiſhing This bread from Other bread, that it will take away the Specifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from an Egg, a Stone, or a Scorpion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is ſo contrary to the nature of a Demonſtrative, as Black is from White; whereof One is ſaid to Congregate, the Other to Segregate.</p>
               <p>And the Conſtant Practice of All mankind contradicts it. For whoever ſheweth any thing to another, and ſtileth it [This] Doth not pretend to diſable him from judging what it is in its kind, but to difference it from Others of the ſame kind; doth not pretend to Contradict his ſenſe, but to Direct it.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Caius</hi> ſhew <hi>Titus</hi> a Guinny, and ſay [<hi>This you ſhall have, if</hi> &amp;c.] he wold do him injuſtice if he gave him a Shilling inſtead of it, pretending he meant not by the word THIS any determinate coin; nor would Any arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator judge, but he muſt pay what the conſtant import of the Phraſe called for, <hi>i. e.</hi> what to ſenſe the piece appeared to be worth, which <hi>Cajus</hi> pointed to by the word THIS.</p>
               <p>The caſe is the ſame on both ſides; as it muſt not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Leſs, ſo muſt it not More; but juſt the ſame as the ſenſe to which it is ſhewen takes it for: If Therefore to All ſenſes it appear Bread, the Demonſtrative will not make it Any thing elſe: it will leave it its Proper Nature of Bread, and Add to That Nature ſome Encloſure from the Common, to exclude All Other but THIS only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That our Lord pointed Not at the Elements, but the Action, is the concept of a greater than <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> of our Church; which he bildeth upon the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59001:37"/> diſagreement of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>But it is contradicted by the Other Element; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth more neceſſarily require that the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ſhould be applyed to the Cup, than the other <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> can forbid it to be applyed to the Bread: And the two Elements being joined in the ſame intereſts, often help one another in the interpretation of what is not equally expreſſed, but muſt equally be implyed, as equally belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Both.</p>
               <p>Nor can we abſtract the Action from the Subject, but muſt take the whole complex together: This Action, Thus performed, with THIS Bread and THIS Cup. For our Lord firſt Declared what THIS IS, before He Commanded us to DO THIS.</p>
               <p>We cannot therefore perform the Action, until we know what is the Neceſſary Mater: becauſe the Action is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to THIS bread, and the Common nature of bread is determined to THIS only, with excluſion of All Other, and That before the Action hath paſſed upon it.</p>
               <p>I have (I doubt) tired my good Reader with this dry kind of reaſoning: I come now to another kind of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, probably more Satisfactory, certainly leſs Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom.</p>
               <p>If I can ſhew ſom ſpecial Bread and Cup, that ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fit both our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> and the <hi>Apostl's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> thereupon; This probably may be more perſuaſive than Any Logical Demonſtration whatſoever, that there <hi>Muſt be ſuch an One,</hi> let us therefor try if ſuch can be found.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>VVHEN Grammar and Logik can diſcover nothing to us, but our Want, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſet us upon the indiſpenſible task of enquiring after the <hi>Extraordinary Bread and Cup,</hi> honored above All Other both by our Lord and Apoſtle, but cannot direct us one ſtep in our way to find them; Whither ſhall we go but to Hiſtory, the laſt interpreter of Thoſe ſayings, whoſe Obſcurity is derived only from That duſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with time hath covered them.</p>
               <p>It is the very frequent fate of many a good Speech (and the very Sound ſheweth it ſo of This) that their meaning dependeth upon the Cuſtoms of remote Time and Place for which they were Calculated, and with which alone they are to be Retrived.</p>
               <p>Let us therefor put our ſelvs in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Place and Time, and enquire into their Publik aſſemblies, if poſſibly we may therein meet ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="1">I. FESTING in Gods Publik worſhip, was Then, and before that time, ſo Univerſal to All Nations and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59001:38"/> Religions, that it may ſeem derived from the light of Nature: But that it was the Practice of the Apoſtles and their Coaetaneos Churches, the book of their Acts ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declares; and that it was ſo in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> the Apoſtles reproof muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe, both in his Charge wherewith it is Uſhered, and his Evidences wherewith it is Proved: And This alone can give us a good account of that ſolemn and otherwiſe inſignificant, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. whoſe Implicit meaning is only thus to be Explicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As often as you Eat this Bread</hi> (which in All your aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies you conſtantly Eat) <hi>and Drink This Cup,</hi> (which you alſo Conſtantly Drink) <hi>you ſhew forth the Lords death</hi> (by vertue of that Inſtitution, whereby I have declared to you by revelation from himſelf) he Conſecrated them to That uſe.</p>
               <p>By this light, as the Importance of That <hi>verſ,</hi> ſo its Connexion both with the preceding and following, and its irrefragable Force toward his deſign, manifeſtly appear, not leaving One ſyllable Obſcure or Unſerviceable in the the whole Diſſertation.</p>
               <p>BUT thogh it ſuffice for the Apoſtles Argument, it doth not for our Lords Inſtitution: We hereby find To what ſtate our Lord had preferred it, but not From what? And we are obliged to enquire out ſuch a Special bread and cup, as may anſwer <hi>[This]</hi> in our Lords hand, before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Church had celebrated it, or Himſelf commanded them ſo to do.</p>
               <p>If we underſtand it to ſignify no more nor leſs but a Feſt, it cannot be denied that <hi>[Eating bread]</hi> was but another phraſe to ſignify Feſting, and the Expreſſion will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the Apoſtles Argument to ſay, That our Lord by This Inſtitution commanded, that as All of All Religions, conſecrated All their publik Feaſts to the honor of their ſeveral Gods; ſo ſhould His own Worſhippers conſecrate All Theirs to His own memory.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59001:39"/>
               <p>Did this ſens agree as well with the Actions and Words of the Inſtitution, as it doth with the Apoſtles Comment thereupon, I know not why it ſhould be refuſed: But bread in That ſtile muſt ſignify the Whole Supper, All the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, as well as the bread and wine; for in cuſtomary ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Eating bread ſignified eating fleſh, fiſh, and what ever els was provided: whereas our Lord took the bread, brake and diſtributed it, leaving the reſt of the Proviſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched the while: And beſide the Bread, he took the Cup alſo, and that, After ſupper was ended, pointing to This no leſs ſolenly than to That, which in common ſpeaking comprehended it: And all the while the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was not honored with the leaſt Touch of his finger or Word of his mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">II. 2. <hi>THE Paſchal Lamb!</hi> Well remembred! Did then our Lord point at This, not as A Supper, but as The Paſſover? Let us conſider,</p>
               <p>He imbraced <hi>This Paſſover</hi> with the greateſt affection. <hi>With a deſire</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>i. e.</hi> wirh a vehement deſire, <hi>have I deſired to Eat This Paſſover with you before I ſuffer;</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly (as declaring his reaſon) proceeded to this Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And what could more fitly repreſent his death when Paſt, than That which moſt lively prefigured it while Future?</p>
               <p>If beſide this, the Jews in their Paſſover uſed our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>[This]</hi> in ſuch a Form, as did no leſs plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure this Inſtitution, than the Sacrificed Lamb did the death of the Author; then muſt it ſeem reaſonable that he choſe that Form, with the ſame affection that he did that Seaſon: and if ſo, then muſt we meſure our Lords <hi>[This]</hi> by that of the Jews, makeing the reſemblance an evidence that the One was the iſſue of the Other.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore to the Jewiſh rituals: The <hi>Law of Moſes</hi> requireth <hi>Unleavened Bread,</hi> and for That reaſon to This day they honor Bread with many ceremonios ſolenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59001:39"/> Before, In, and After Supper. Particularly, they break a Cake into two unequal parts: The greater part the Maſter of the Feſt hideth under a cuſhion, there to be kept ſafe till the end of Supper. Then doth he ſolenly bring it forth, diſtributing it among the gueſts, and ſaying, <hi>This is the bread of affliction which your fathers ate in Egypt, whoever is hungry, let him come and eat of the Paſchal Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And have we not now found our ſo much ſought for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bread, exactly anſwering what This bread is more than any Other bread? Do not All features exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur? The Seaſon, the Mater, the Form of words, All Circumſtances the ſame?</p>
               <p>This is ſo plauſible, that to this very Day (thogh not for this Reaſon) many look upon the Paſſover as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and conſequently the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of our Performance: Many think that women have no right to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> becauſe they had none to the <hi>Paſsover;</hi> and (which is more proper to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that we are not obliged to receve it but at <hi>Eaſter</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe That was celebrated only at the ſame ſeaſon. And that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were of this Later opinion, the more we conſider it, the more probable will it appear; but moſt manifeſt, that the Apoſtle hath utterly confuted it: For he firſt reproveth them as profaning the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> not in their <hi>Paſchal</hi> only, but their Ordinary meetings, and then convinceth them that it is concerned in them All; whereby the Former error is alſo deſtroyed, unleſs its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons will exclude all women, not only from the <hi>Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but his Houſe too.</p>
               <p>The Paſchal bread therefore, 'though it exactly anſwer our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> yet can it by no means agree with the Apoſtles gloſs; and we muſt not reſt till we meet an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for All <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as well in the One as the Other.</p>
               <p>YET have we not loſt our labor. For as the Chemiſt,

               <p n="1">1. That ſince our Lord in the ſame Circumſtances uſed the ſame Word, we ought to underſtand him in the ſame Sens.

That ſince [This in the Jewiſh Paſſover, pointeth at a Singular remarkable piece of <hi>bread,</hi> diſtinguiſhed from All others of the Kind, by its Proper circumſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is to be eaten; therefore [This] in our <hi>Lords Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> muſt likewiſe point at ſome Special bread, known by the Circumſtance of eating it, from All ordinary bread.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thogh we have not hereby found what are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Marks whereby we may know [This] from Common bread, yet we have the Way wherein we are to ſeek it. For ſince there is no other defect in the Paſchal, but This, that it anſwereth not the Apoſtles diſſertation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth their Ordinary Feſts; it muſt needs concern us to enquire into the forms of their Common Feſts, if poſſibly we may therein find, not only ſuch a Special bread, but ſuch a Special cup too, as may anſwer both our Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and his word [This] in his Inſtitution, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles explication too, whereby he proveth them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only in the Paſsover, but generally in Church Feſts.</p>
               <p n="3">III. 3. LET us therefore again to the Jewiſh Ritual. Behold, at the very firſt Step we receve ſuch light, as leaves Nothing unſatisfied but our Wonder, that the Jewiſh Rabbins ſhould be better Commentators upon our Lords and his Apoſtles words, and diſcover more to us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59001:40"/> of the Original, Nature, and Deſign of our great Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; than All the Chriſtian Doctors, who ſo long and ſo much have labored to honor it with their explications.</p>
               <p>Becauſe they are ſhort and full, take the words of <hi>Leo Modena,</hi> a modern Rabbin; and to remove all doubt of his veracity, you ſhall find the ſame ſaid by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Syn.

When they have do'n eating they waſh their hands, and take their knives from off the table, becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Table repreſenteth an Altar, upon which no iron tool was to come. And if they be three or more that eat together, then doth one of them command a glaſs to be waſhed, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with wine, he taketh it up from off the table, ſaying with a loud voice, Sirs, let us bleſs His name with whoſe good things we have be'n filled. After this, the maſter of the houſe bleſſeth it, and prayeth for peace; and having ſo do'n, he giveth to each of them a little of That wine which he hath in his glaſs, and he himſelf alſo drinketh of it, and ſo they riſe from the table.</hi>

               <p>The Neceſſity conſidered, which lieth ſo hard upon us to find ſome Special Bread and Cup, which may equally anſwer both our Saviors and Apoſtles THIS: we may juſtly, upon That ſingle account, require any Diſſenter to admit of This, or ſhew us a Better.</p>
               <p>But the Reſemblance conſidered, we may challenge him not only to ſhew a better Tally to our Lords Inſtitution, but any Pictur better anſwering the life. Yea, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that we were allowed to Forge what we pleaſed,

                  <hi>After they are ſat down, the maſter of the houſe taketh a laaf of bread</hi> (ſaith the Rabby.) Our Lord diſtributed The bread, <hi>when he had given thanks</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) as they ſat at meat</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Luke.</hi>

                  <hi>Codrus</hi> (or ſome ſuch brave Prince) the night before he ſacrificed his life for his people, delivered into the hands of his chief Officers a Cabinet, telling them, he therein bequeathed them his very heart, and requiring them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to produce it in every Aſſembly as a laſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his death. It contained his directions for its uſe legible enough throgh its Chriſtal covering, but much more if opened with its annexed key. They receved it with all due reverence, and while the memory of their ſo deſerving King was yet freſh, they conſtantly obeyed his command. But after ſome ages, as their love cooled toward his Perſon, ſo did their regard to his Legacy. Which the Officers lamenting, and endeavoring not only to reſtore it to its due reverence, but to advance it higher, told the people, That however incredible it might ſeem, they muſt believe what their dying Lord told them; <hi>viz.</hi> That in this Cabinet he left them his very heart, which therefore they muſt adore as his Royal Perſon. And leſt by opening it, any one might therein find the Kings plain directions, they laid aſide the key, and then omitted the uſe of the Cabinet it ſelf (except only upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſeaſons) pretending that too frequent uſe ſullied it. When many conſidering and conſiderable Perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that they were brought the back way to the ſame contemt, as former ages were condemned for; a certain Officer of a midle rank, knowing the Kings directions could not otherwiſe be legible, ſought about till he had found the forgotten key; and upon tryal, finding it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to anſwer every ward, brought it into public vieu,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59001:42"/> pleading, that ſuch a concurs of lock and key in ſo many wards, could not be fortuit; and ſeeing Some key muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be had, they who refuſed This, muſt be obliged to produce a Better. And becauſe the metal was objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt as baſe braſs or iron, no way ſuitable to the richneſs of the Cabinet, and the Jewels therein contained: he fell to ſcouring it from that ruſt wherewith Time and Neglect (if not Deſign) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> covered it; and finding it pure Gold, turned that Objection Againſt its worthineſs, into an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence For is. And thinking that All cavils muſt be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly anſwered by a duble ocular Demonſtration, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it round in the lock, ſhewing that all its parts were as well ſuited to all the wards thereof, as its matter was to the worth of the Cabinet it ſelf.</p>
               <p>What ſucceſs this had with the people, my Author doth not inform me; but this proceeding ſeemeth ſo genuine, that I ſhall follow it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew that the Jewiſh Tradition was fit for the honor of a Sacrament. Secondly, That it exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth our Lords Inſtitution. And thirdly, That it ſerveth every ſyllable of the Apoſtl's Diſſertation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> No more diſhonor to This than to the other Sacrament, to be derived from a Jewiſh Tradition. This Tradition more worthy than That. <hi>II.</hi> In what ſens our Lords Table is an Altar? Were our behavior at Table more pious, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment need not be aſhamed of ſuch a relation. <hi>III.</hi> Our Lords form of conſecration derived from the Jewiſh Forms, both Feſtival and Sacrificial.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT it is a diſhonor to This Sacrament to ow its original to a Jewiſh Tradition, can ill be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who make no ſuch ſcruple againſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, which yet deriveth its Inſtitution from the ſame Author, and its Extraction from the ſame Family.</p>
               <p>That had loſt its Key almoſt as long as This; for an Age hath not paſt over us, ſince it was found among the ſame Jewiſh rubbidge; yet are we not aſhamed to expound thoſe Evangelical allegories, Regeneration, New birth, New creature, Old man and New man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Jewiſh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, which ſpeak them more than Allegorical effects of Baptiſm upon Proſelytes.</p>
               <p>NOR is This Sacrament barely Equal, but much Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to That, both by Natural and Poſitive Law. For the Jewiſh Baptiſm was a mere naked Ceremony, Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant (indeed) of the purity required in the perſon which received it, but neither Derived from it, nor Effective of it.</p>
               <p>But This Feſtival ſolennity did not only Repreſent, but really Exerciſe and Improve, and 'twas its ſelf the iſſue of true Piety.</p>
               <p>Their affectation of Ceremonies might (for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in Scripture) be all the reaſon which moved Them to Baptiſe their Proſelytes: but to bleſs God for his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59001:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> is a worſhip acceptable to God above <hi>all burnt-offerings and ſacrifice,</hi> though inſtituted by himſelf, as appeareth in the 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where he rejecteth Thoſe and approveth This, ſaying, <hi>He that offereth me praiſe, he honoreth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if even under the Law, much more under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel muſt ſuch a Service be acceptable, which carrieth in its countenance ſuch fair Characters of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And as it hath more of Gods Image, ſo hath it of his Superſcription; more Authority from Poſitive, as well as more Dignity from Natural Law.</p>
               <p>That Gods people ſhould Baptiſe their Proſelytes, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> took no care; but that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Bounty in feeding them it made ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. For <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.3. we find it thus written, <hi>What man ſoever there be of the houſe of Iſrael that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to offer an offering unto the Lord before the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Lord: blood ſhall be imputed to that man, he hath ſhed blood: and that man ſhall be cut off from among his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that killed an Ox, yea Goat or Lamb, was, if he ſlew a man and rob'd God; if he did not expiate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed life, and acquire a new title to the fleſh, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to (that he might receive it from) the Lord of all.</p>
               <p>This was eaſily enough performable when the People and Tabernacle travelled, and lodged together in the ſame Camp: But when the Camp was disbanded throgh the whole Land, and the Tabernacle fixed in one City, then did neceſſity plead for a diſpenſation from the unpractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty.</p>
               <p>And this neceſſary Diſpenſation we find granted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.21. <hi>If the place which the Lord hath choſen to put his name there, be too far from thee: then thou ſhalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the Lord hath given thee, as I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59001:43"/> have commanded thee, and thou ſhalt eat in thy gates whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy ſoul luſteth after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words God ſheweth his kindneſs to his former Law, no leſs plainly than to his people. That muſt ſtill be obeyed as far as it was practicable; and what diſtance was too great, while he did not determin, but left it to the piety of the people, he thereby obliged them to enlarge it as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>AND THEY in thankfulneſs for the favor, thoght no diſtance great enogh: But if the remoteneſs of their dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings permitted them not to bring their Meat to the Altar, found a way to bring the Altar to their Meat: Not really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (for That the Law forbad) but the Repreſentation and more: taking for a rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Quod Altare expiat hoc Menſa expiat.</hi> They gave their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Tables the title of Altars, and their Meat they ſtiled Offering; Salt they therefor made neceſſary for the one, bicauſe Gods Law had made it ſo for the other: When they came to That Office, for whoſe ſake the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory became reaſonable, the Benediction; they removed their Knives upon This expreſs reaſon, becauſe the Law forbad any Iron tool to come upon Gods Altar: And by many other Ceremonies indeavored to make the Succeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum anſwer the Principal.</p>
               <p n="2">II. TO THIS probably, certainly to no better ſens, muſt thoſe frequent Expreſſions of our Chriſtian Fathers be reduced.</p>
               <p>When they ſpeak of the Sacrament of the Altar, they uſe the ſame Allegory, but mean thus much more than the Jewiſh Doctors; that the Holy Feſt is not only a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Sacrifice (as were the Jewiſh) but a Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative: Doth not ſet forth what our ſelves would do, if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59001:44"/> we had opportunity, but what our Lord hath actually ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
               <p>And if the Jews thoght it ſufficient reaſon to call their own Table an Altar, bicauſe they did what themſelves thoght fit to make it Repreſent one, much more may we call That holy Table an Altar, and That Holy Meat a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which (not by our own voluntary Act, but by our Lords expreſs Command) doth not barely Repreſent, but Exhibit his fleſh and blood.</p>
               <p>Nor is it ſufficient reaſon, that becauſe ſom ſtrain the Allegory too far, we ſhould therefor abhor any uſe of it. Why ſhould it be Unlawful or Unfit; yea, why ſhould it not be moſt Proper, for Us to borrow the Allegory from the Same Tradition, from which our Lord borrowed the Inſtitution? Had it be'n Sacrilegios in the Jews to ſtile their Table by That ſacred title, our Lord doubtleſs would not ſo have juſtified them by honoring the Tradition: Why then ſhould we not think it Equally lawful, ſince it is More proper, to give This much Holier Table the ſame title, wherewith the Jews honored their domeſtick ones without any ſuch warrant.</p>
               <p>WOULD to God we would ſo imitate the Jews, that not only the Lords, but Our own tables might ſome way anſwer That name. For it is to be conſidered, to Our ſhame, but to the honor both of That people and This their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and conſequently to the ſilencing of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are now anſwering, That the ſame Piety which induced them ſo to Conſecrate their tables, conciliated ſuch Reverence toward them, as repreſented what is due to the Altar it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> of Old, and their Modern Rabins to This day, boſt of their Sobriety as beyond that of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people, which (if true) may very reaſonably be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Piety wherewith they thus begin and end their freeſt intertenements.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59001:44"/>
               <p>We are apt to meſure others by our ſelves; and becauſe we ſee too many of our great Tables ſo unlike Altars, that they ſhun, or run down all appearance of Religion: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we Sit down and Riſe like Quakers, Riot like <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> and Talk like Atheiſts, without any bleſſing before or after Meat, or any mention of Piety (but to baf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le it) while we are eating: bicauſe we have degenerated not only from Primitive Chriſtianity, but from the litl Piety pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed ſo lately, even by our ſelvs, who a few years ſince would have be'n aſhamed of a Grace-leſs meat: we are therefore apt to believe the Jews as bad as our Selves, or our Neighbors; and conſequently, that there could be nothing in their Feſts capable of our Lords approbation, becauſe there is not in our own.</p>
               <p>But if we remember that our Lord bleſſed his loaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diſtributed them, we muſt needs think This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample better worth our imitation, than that of the <hi>French:</hi> and if we believe he did therein comply with the Cuſtoms of his Nation, and that Thoſe Cuſtoms were ſuch as their Rabbins deſcribe, we may reaſonably both admit that to be true which their Writers boſt concerning their Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and impute That Sobriety to thoſe Cuſtoms: and then we may well believe that the Tradition which made the Table emulate an Altar, was ſo far from Unworthy, that it was moſt Fit to be adopted into the Goſpel, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with an immortal relation to our Lords Perſon.</p>
               <p>Our Key therefor is of the moſt noble metal poſſible. Had it be'n immediatly injoyned by any poſitive law of God, it muſt have be'n Deſtroyed, Not Perpetuated by the coming of that Body which Aboliſhed ſuch Shadows: Yet doth it cary ſuch legible Intimations ever from that very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59001:45"/> that we may well glory in the Mater of the Key, as no way Unworthy its office.</p>
               <p n="3">III. YEA from this diſcovery of ſuitableneſs in point of Worthineſs, we may derive another in point of Fitneſs. It will invite us to compare our Lords Form of Conſecration, with ſom of their Sacrificial, as we have do'n his Mater with their Feſtival; and ſo doing, we ſhall find as great a reſemblance between Thoſe, as between Theſe: Which muſt double the probability of the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing it carieth apparent marks, not of Father only but Grandfather too; not only of the Tradition, but the Rite of Sacrificing whence that Tradition was derived.</p>
               <p>LET us then conſider. The Inſtitution-Supper, as it was Feſtival ſo was it Sacrificial; more particularly, it was Paſchal, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Feſt of unleavened Bread. And Bread was, and ſtill is therein honored with a ſolen Diſtribution, and theſe words, <hi>This is the bread of affliction which your fathers ate in Egypt.</hi> Do you not perceve the air of our Lords Form? <hi>This is my body which is given for you?</hi> If not, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that of the Cup.</p>

                  </gap> we doubt This to be a copy of That? Can we doubt but This pointeth at That, as its ſhadow, now to diſappear?</p>
               <p>Neither the Jewiſh ſtile, which caleth their Table an Altar; nor the Chriſtian, which caleth this the Sacrament

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> A plainer proof from <hi>Chap. 10.</hi> From the ſameneſs of names. In the Cup the <hi>Greeks</hi> aped the <hi>Jews:</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſtileth the Cup of the Lord, the Cup of bleſſing, which is a perfect tranſlation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> name. <hi>II.</hi> The break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread, a Jewiſh phraſe. <hi>III.</hi> Some Phaenomena not ſalvable but by this Hypotheſis. <hi>IV.</hi> He expreſly tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that each part of the Jewiſh Tradition, by name, is a part of our Lords Supper. <hi>V.</hi> An Illuſtration from our Grace-cup. <hi>VI.</hi> A Sacrament, What?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NEVER did Talies more exactly agree, than do <hi>This Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>That Tradition,</hi> both in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Circumſtances: Yet ſhall we be content to let all this paſs for Accidental, and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thence derivable for Incompetent, if we confirm it not by a Demonſtration as full and unanſwerable as the Subject can bear, or the moſt Sceptical perſon require.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Prince had be'n long loſt, and his Friends had met with a perſon of Princely deportment, carrying in his countenance all the features, and in his voice the perfect tone of the loſt Prince: This muſt certainly make them full of hopes that it was the ſame; and what greater ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction would they deſire, than This, that ſom credibl per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his retinu ſhould giv in his clear Teſtimony that it was ſo? And what clearer teſtimony could any ſuch perſon give, or how could he more effectually expreſs it? than by naming him by his proper name, and declaring that this Perſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>med, was the Prince they deſired.</p>
               <p>If therefor we find the Apoſtle call the Lords Supper in each Element, by the very ſame names as the Jews did each Mater in their Tradition, and then declare them to be the Communion, the one of his Body, and the other of Blood, I might hope the evidence capable to ſilence all doubts.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59001:46"/>
               <p>Look we then back to the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter,</hi> and obſerve his motions and expreſſions.</p>
               <p>His Deſign there, is to diſſuade his <hi>Corinthians</hi> from communicating with Heathens in their Idols Temples: His Medium for this, he there taketh from the ſame To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pik, as he doth here for the reproofs of their miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in the Church: As Here the Lords Supper is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Intemperance, ſo is it There with Idolatros Feſts.</p>
               <p>There is (ſaith he implicitely) the ſame relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church of Chriſt, his Table, and his Cup, with Us; as between the Temple of the Idol, his Table, and his Cup, with Them: Theſe are the Characteriſtiks of an Idolater, as Thoſe are of a Chriſtian; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for you cannot uſe them Both, bicauſe you cannot at once be of Both families.</p>
               <p>In preſſing this Argument, he ſo manageth each part of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> as may beſt anſwer the Cuſtoms of the Heathen, from which he is to diſſuade them.</p>
               <p>That they uſed any benedictions of Bread, is nether manifeſt nor probable, becauſe not ſo ſuitable to the <hi>Greeks</hi> humor, which ran all upon Drinking. But their Cloſing-cup is ſo evident, that they, who above all Nations in the World were excellent at Both, Speaking, and Drinking, could not find a word more expreſſive of Drunkenneſs, than <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if it were the inſeparable attendant of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeing.</p>
               <p>And that in their other Feſts they aped this Tradition, as in their Sacrificing they did the Law, appeareth by what we find in many of their Poets and other Writers.</p>
               <p>I mention only the <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> who ſeemeth litle more than a Tranſlator of the laſt claus of our Rabby, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The cuſtom was to offer drink to the good daemon, when the Table was about to be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doth the Apoſtle ſo lay hold on, as to expreſs in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59001:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> their own abominable ſtile: therein oppoſing Name to Name, as expreſly as he doth Cup to Cup; caleth That by the Name themſelves had given it <hi>[the Cup of Devils]</hi> (for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is only the diminitive of their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) And thereto oppoſeth the <hi>[Cup of the Lord]</hi> by the very ſame Name, which the Jews in the above-mentioned Tradition knew it by.</p>
               <p>For this I urge as moſt conſiderable, that to this day they call their cloſeing Cup, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which it is not poſſible to tranſlate into <hi>Greek</hi> more exactly than the Apoſtle hath do'n by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The Strength (or at leaſt the Evidence) of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dependeth upon the Sameneſs of the Name; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he here pointeth at the Cup, no leſs (yea perhaps more) plainly,, than we have ſeen him do in the next Chapter by his Demonſtrative <hi>[This]</hi> and I think it not eaſy to find a third way, wherein he could have more clearly have do'n it. No properer way of determining an Individuum, than either to call him by his proper Name <hi>[Peter,</hi> or <hi>John, &amp;c.]</hi> or by pointing at him, and ſaying <hi>[This man.]</hi> Thus do theſe two Arguments mutually enlighten each other; and Both concur to make it manifeſt, that the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing</hi> in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. and that pointed at by the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>This</hi> in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, are the ſame with that which the Jews honored, both in the ſame Circumſtances, and by the ſame Name too.</p>
               <p n="2">II. AND this will be yet more evident when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he is no leſs careful to ſpeak of the Bread in the ſame Jewiſh ſtile, caling that alſo by its tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lame.</p>
               <p>For the Jews throughout their <hi>Miſna</hi> and <hi>Talmud,</hi> call this part of their <hi>Tradition</hi> by the ſame Name, as doth the Apoſtle in this place, and whereby it is ſtill knowen in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> They call it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which Phraſe cannot be more exactly tranſlated than by <hi>[The breaking of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59001:47"/> the Bread]</hi> Yea, this is ſo expreſſive with them, that it is diverbial to ſtile <hi>the head of the family</hi> from this office, and the whole performance by one word.</p>
               <p>This you may plainly diſcover by what the lerned and laborios<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctor <hi>Castel,</hi> in his <hi>Heptaglot Lexicon,</hi> ſaith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="3">III. LEt us now obſerv how the Apoſtle treateth theſe parts of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> under theſe their Proper names,; and we ſhall find ſtill more proof of his reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing This tradition.</p>
               <p>He caleth That <hi>[the cup of Bleſſing]</hi> but he doth not call This <hi>[the bread of Bleſſing]</hi> and why not? Two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts more expreſly note, that our <hi>Lord bleſſed it,</hi> and the third agreeth with our Apoſtle, that he <hi>gave thanks</hi> before he <hi>brake it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide he caleth This <hi>[the bread which we break]</hi> but doth not ſtile That <hi>[the cup which we diſtribute]</hi> yet doth our Lord ſpeak it more plainly of the Cup, than of the Bread, <hi>Take This and divide it among your ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other reaſon for this duble difference of ſtiles we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Find, and Better we cannot Deſire than This; that as our Lord borrowed both Parts of his Inſtitution from the Jewiſh tradition, ſo did the Apoſtle both their Names.</p>
               <p>Again, the Apoſtle keepeth to the Jewiſh ſtile in the Cup, ſaying, <hi>[You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils]</hi> but in the other part he quitteth the name of <hi>[Bread]</hi> changing it for <hi>[Table]</hi> and ſaying, <hi>[You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be partakers of the Lords [Table] and of the [Table] of devils.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for this he had ſufficient reaſon, if the <hi>Greeks</hi> did
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59001:48"/> not (what we find no reaſon to believ they did) conſecrate Bread as they did Wine, in All, yea or Any of their Feſts: but if we quit This reaſon, we ſhall hardly find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Yet again. The Bread had the Firſt Place both in the Jewiſh Tradition, and the Lords Inſtitution: yet <hi>ver.</hi> 16. he giveth the Cup precedence.</p>
               <p>Why doth he thus croſs his hands, as old <hi>Jacob</hi> did, preferring the Cadet before the Firſt born? What's the reaſon? were his eyes dim, or his choice irreſpective? By no means. For we ſhall again find him in the ſame partiality, and upon the ſame reaſon, becauſe the Cup was more ſerviceable to his Argument than the Bread.</p>
               <p>In This place it better demonſtrates the inconſiſtency between the Church of Chriſt which bleſſed it, and an Idols Temple which did not; and in That, it better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth a Feſt, which requireth the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> from a common Supper, which doth not.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt not the Bread be ſo depoſed from its primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, as to be left without its bleſſing: Thogh the <hi>Greeks</hi> cuſtom had no rival for it, yet our Lords Supper hath need of it, and muſt not be maimed of the one half; equally neceſſary to <hi>His Table,</hi> thogh not to the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thogh therefor he cannot now (as in the Cup) oppoſe Name to Name, yet he doth Thing to Thing, Table to Table; and under that ſtile, payeth the Bread the ſame Juſtice, thogh not the ſame Deference, as he doth the Cup.</p>
               <p>Look we now which way we will, we meet clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; Direct, in the ſo careful caling each Element by its proper Name; and Collateral, in the no leſs careful Tranſplaceing them, ſuitably to the aſpect they had upon his Deſign; yet doing right to the Inſtitution and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by mentioning the Bread, as neceſſary to Theſe, thogh not to That.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59001:48"/>IV. WHat more can be Expected? yea, What more can be Deſired? muſt we prove not only that here are the ſame Names, but the ſame Perſon too?</p>
               <p>This is do'n, 8.15, 16. <hi>I ſpeak as to the wiſe men; judge ye what I ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can now any thing be plaine could any Lawyer or Grammarian more clearly and properly have expreſſed, that the <hi>ſame bread and cup</hi> whoſe names he had thus tranſlated from <hi>Hebrew</hi> to <hi>Greek,</hi> were by our Lord tranſlated from the Jewiſh Tradition to his Own Inſtitution? Are not Thoſe the ſame with Theſe?</p>
               <p>I cannot pretend any ſtronger Proof, but I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to Illuſtrate it by a Cuſtom of our own, in our accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Feſts, hitherto unaccounted.</p>
               <p n="5">V. OUr predeceſſors have no leſs exactly tranſlated the name of the Jewiſh cup into Engliſh, than hath the Apoſtle into Greek. What They caled <hi>[Bleſſing the Table]</hi> We call <hi>[Saying Grace]</hi> and This anſwereth That in Both ſenſes, Praying or Praiſing, Imploring a Bleſſing upon the Meat before we eat, or returning Thanks for it after we have eaten. Our Grace-cup therefore, deriveth its Proper Name from St. <hi>Pauls Cup of Bleſſing,</hi> by exact tranſlation of the word.</p>
               <p>And this ſame Cup hath a Sirname, derived from the Same original by another Apoſtle. In <hi>Acts</hi> 20. we find the Primitive Churches met every <hi>firſt day of the week to break bread.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. Upon this day they made their contributions to the poor; ſo joining their Charity to the Lords Myſtical Body, with their Honor to his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſo highly approveth, as to denominat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59001:49"/> thoſe meetings [<hi>Feſts of charity</hi> J whence our Anceſtors have given this Grace-cup its Surname, the <hi>Cup of Charity,</hi> as uſed in thoſe Feſts of Charity. I wiſh they had be'n as careful to preſerve the ſignificance, as the ceremony and the duble name.</p>
               <p>But if from Theſe we may learn That, we find Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters legible enogh to inform us: The Cup of Bleſſing and our Grace-cup have Both the ſame Name, the ſame Mater, the ſame Circumſtances; after Grace, after Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſuch order that not one of the Gueſts can be paſt by; It's the Laſt action before riſing, requireth the ſame Number, three at leaſt.</p>
               <p>We find that however the remoter Churches met the <hi>Firſt day of the week to break bread,</hi> yet <hi>the Apostles at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> did it <hi>daily;</hi> and Religios Fraternities think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged, rather to take their paterns from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic College, than the Graecian Churches; as our Church requireth more conſtancy in Collegiate and Cathedral Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities, than Parochial.</p>
               <p>When the Governors of the Church, upon urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſity, changed the Seaſon for the people, who were not to be truſted after Supper; they recompenced the thus injured Seaſon, with a ſuccedaneos Sacrament in the Grace-cup, as the Jews did their unattended Temple, with a ſuccedaneos Sacrifice in the Tradition.</p>
               <p>The concurrence of two ſuch Names, evidently deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſame Cup, no leſs remarkable, than that of all other circumſtances, dubleth the evidence.</p>
               <p>All this may well juſtify a challenge to the gainſayer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accept of This, or produce a better: Yea perhaps it might be urged, that we cannot avoid, but that we muſt own either the <hi>cup of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>the cup of divels,</hi> there being no other imaginable Original for the unaccountable Grace-cup.</p>
               <p>Yet as I will not diſparage the Table in our Chappel, by equaling it with That in our Hall; ſo neither will I my
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59001:49"/> better Evidences, by leveling them with a mere Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, how ever Probable.</p>
               <p>I therefor take it, not as we may ſuppoſe it delivered down by our Anceſtors, but as it is ſtill practiſed among our Selvs: not as a Proof of a pios cuſtom in the Churches of Chriſt, but as an Illuſtration of his Own meaning.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we then, that our Lord ſhould again viſit the Earth, convene a Council truly General, make a publik Feſt, declare his great ſatisfaction in the Opportunity; and then, in its proper Seaſon, and with all due Circumſtances, take the Grace-cup and deliver it about, with the ſame Words as he did that in his Inſtitution, ſaying, <hi>This is,</hi> &amp;c. would we then doubt, but by the Particl <hi>This,</hi> he pointed at That Cup, ſo in his hand, under the long knowen cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Grace-cup?</p>
               <p>If This would not put us out of doubt, let us further ſuppoſe, that our Lords chief Secretary ſhould profeſs, that he had to him declared his meaning; and that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable perſon, ſhould not only deſcribe the Grace-cup by its proper characters, but even it by its proper name, and in plain words tell us, that the <hi>Grace-cup which we drink, is the Communion of the blood of Chriſt:</hi> Would any one now doubt, but the Grace-cup, ſo Circumſtanced, and ſo Named, and ſo pointed at, muſt be the peculiar <hi>cup of the Lord,</hi> which muſt cary its old Conſtancy to a new Dignity?</p>
               <p>If this amount not to Full Evidence, yet ſure we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it to be more then Half, and then the Civil Law will allow us to bring a Suppletory.</p>
               <p>The Bread then, joineth its Evidence with this of the Cup. In our Lords Inſtitution it holdeth the ſame Place, as in the Jewiſh Tradition: In the Apoſtles Argument, by loſs of its Place, it is advanced in Power; for by its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſo alloyed, it appeareth, that thogh rhe Apoſtles Argument were, yet was not our Lords Inſtitution, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete without it; for which there can be no other reaſon given, but this, that it was an equally Neceſſary part
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59001:50"/> of the Tradition, whence the whole Supper was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
               <p>Let us therefor carefully compare them: What Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? what Feature? what Meen? what Motion is there in the Tradition that is not anſwered, both in our Lords Inſtitution, and in each of the Apoſtles Arguments? What Family can ſhew a Son, ſo lively reſembling both Father and Grandfather? what Artiſt a Picture more exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Original? what Wiſdom leſs then that of <hi>the wonderful Counſailer,</hi> could have invented a Rite, more perfectly ſetting forth the Tradition it copieth, the Paſſion is commemorateth, the Benefits it exhibiteth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not upon all theſe Evidences crave your Sentence. There remain other neceſſary Enquiries to be made. We have rejected the Paſsover, becauſe it anſwered not the Apoſtles Argument, thogh it better did ſo our Lords Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; we muſt bring them to the ſame Teſt, and if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not with every title, confeſs all our hopes vain, and labor loſt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. VVHICH yet I am ſo ſecure againſt, that I cannot forbear to anticipate the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That this notice muſt ſilence a multitude of trifling troubleſom queſtions, concerning the definition and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of a <hi>[Sacrament.]</hi>

               <p>And from this we may well take occaſion to warn ſom too zelos perſons, that they need examin, whether there be as good agreement between their own Spirits, and that of our Lord, as we have found between theſe two Cups.</p>
               <p>The Jews were no leſs zelos of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Goſpel, than any Papiſt can be of his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59001:50"/> in oppoſition to Reformation: Our Lord as much aboliſhed Legal Ceremonies, as our Reformers did Popiſh; He as much declared againſt the Traditions of the Scribes, as our Church doth, or needeth to do, againſt Superfluos Ceremonies. Yet, behold! he was ſo far from refuſing their Cuſtoms, for This only reaſon, becauſe they were Theirs; that for This very reaſon, he choſe them.</p>
               <p>He could (doubtleſs) have invented ſom other rite for Matriculating Diſciples, no leſs proper than that of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; and ſom other, for Commemorating his death, than This of the Grace-cup; yet did not diſdain to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Both his Sacraments, from thoſe implacabl Enemies of his Perſon and Goſpel, while he aboliſhed all thoſe Divine Ordinances that prefigured Both: Leaving us an example ſo to ſhun what is prejudicial, as to retain what may be ſerviceabl, and make our adverſaries practice a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to Fly but Embrace it.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING thus found our Key as Fit as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to unlock our Lords Inſtitution; we may with the better corage prove it upon the Apoſtl's Diſcours concerning it: Wherein, as there are More, and ſom of them croſs Wards, ſo if it anſwer them All, in All their turnings, we ſhall have ſo many the More Evidences that it is the tru one.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59001:52"/>
               <p>That we may work regularly, it will be neceſſary in the Firſt place, to Enter it in due manner, <hi>i. e.</hi> begin with a right underſtanding of the Apoſtles proper Deſign, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every word is to be ſerviceable: For it is no ſmall help to a travailer to know which way his journies end lies, and to caſt the Country accordingly.</p>
               <p>His General deſign we cannot miſtake: Nothing can be plainer than This, that it is to convince the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of their guilt in profaning the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> but the Medium whereby he proſecutes this charge, is both Generally and Groſly miſtaken: and ſince this is the Mother error, whence all our Neglects on One hand, and all our Earneſtneſs on the Other, and all our Diſputes on All hands proceed, it cannot be too plainly expoſed: and thogh it be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, yet muſt we crave the Reader to undergo a labor ſo neceſſary, that without it he cannot underſtand what the Apoſtle meaneth throughout his diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>We too haſtily believe, that he endeavoreth to prove no more but this, that our Lords Perſon was concerned in all the abuſes of his Supper; taking it for granted, that they knew how his Supper was concerned in Thoſe Meetings which he reproved: Whereas the more we conſider it, the plainer we ſhall find, that his Direct and Immediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, is to prove the Later, ſuppoſing the Former as ſelf-evident, upon the firſt notice of our Lords Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>So the caſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> toward the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> was much like the Apoſtles Own toward the High Prieſt, Acts 23.4, 5. <hi>They that ſtood by, ſaid, Revileſt thou Gods high priest? Then ſaid</hi> Paul, <hi>I wiſt not, brethren, that he was the high prieſt: For it is written, Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the ruler of thy people:</hi> He reproveth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as the By-ſtanders reproved Him. <hi>Profane you the Lords Holy Supper?</hi> And ſuppoſing them likewiſe to excuſe themſelves in the ſame manner, by ſaying, We wiſt not that it was the <hi>Lords Holy Supper,</hi> for we cannot but know, That muſt be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59001:52"/> celebrated with reverence; he argueth in ſuch manner, as to convince them of what they ſeemed either not to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, or not to Own.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE underſtanding of This will give us great light towards diſcovery of every ſtep; and that this is true, we may the better perceve if we proceed by theſe Enquiries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether this might not be the</hi> Corinthians <hi>caſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What might become the Apoſtle to do in ſuch a caſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How doth the Apoſtles procedure ſuit with ſuch a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This might very well be the</hi> Corinthians <hi>caſe.</hi> For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poſſibly they might ſuppoſe that our Lord pointed at the Bread, as Paſchal, not as Feſtival, and conſequently preferred not Every Feſt, but only the Paſsover to this honor: and for This, there are appearances of reaſon not contemtibl. 1. He choſe the Paſsover for the Seaſon of his Inſtitution, and embraced it with ſuch expreſſions of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as ſeemed Proper to That Particular ſolennity, ſaying, <hi>With a deſire have I deſired to eat</hi> (not this [Supper] but) <hi>this [Paſsover.]</hi> 2. This above All other Feſts, beſt Prefigured his death while Future, and was therefor moſt fit to Commemorate it, when Paſt. 3. The Jews ſaid of the Lamb, <hi>This is the BODY of the Paſsover;</hi> and our Lord ſeemeth to allude to it, ſaying: <hi>This is my BODY.</hi> 4. The Jews diſtributing the Paſchal Cake, ſaid, <hi>THIS IS the Bread of affliction,</hi> &amp;c. and our Lord diſtributing the Bread, ſaid, <hi>THIS IS my Body,</hi> &amp;c. And at That time, having newly filled their minds with phraſes proper to the Seaſon, it is very probable that they might receve our Lords words in ſuch a ſens.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And probably, ſuch an error might proceed from want of a proper form of Words, to accompany the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration. One of the beſt Doctors our Church can boſt of, authoriſeth me to ſay, That ſuch a Form of words (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59001:53"/> Uſeful) is not indiſpenſibly Neceſſary: Our Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined none, and we find not that his Apoſtles either Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed or Taught their Diſciples any: and it was prone for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to ſlide into an error concerning That cup, which carried no Inſcription to declare its contents.</p>
               <p>Certainly from hence came that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of in his days, That Feſts of Charity were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Church without the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> and from hence came our loſs of the meaning (which is the Soul) of our Grace-cup. And on the contrary, the Jews, with the Mater, retene alſo the meaning of their Tradition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both the Bread and Cup are accompanied with ſuch a Form of words as will not ſuffer it to be loſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And poſſibly, they might look upon the Whole as a mere outward Performance: For knowing how litle fondneſs our Lord had toward Such exerciſes, they might thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that he left it in Their choice to Perform or Omit it, as Themſelves ſhould judge convenient: and their Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to their beloved riot, might incline them, both to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertene ſuch an opinion and Improve it. Our <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> muſt ſtrike ſome Aw into their unwilling minds, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding not only Sobriety, but Devotion: And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom ſuch a check muſt be to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> humor, and conſequently how willing they muſt be to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfs from it; if we know not already, we ſhall anon.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have conſidered Probabilities, we come now to Certainty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whatever they Really believed, it is Certain they might Pretend, that they believed our <hi>Lords Supper</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in Thoſe Feſts which the Apoſtle thus reproved: and the very Poſſibility of ſuch a Pretence, no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a confutation, than a Real profeſſion of ſuch a Belief: which requireth us to conſider as our next ſtep.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59001:53"/>III. <hi>VVHat might become the Apoſtle to do in ſuch a caſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it were but Poſſibl for them to believ ſo, Himſelf hath taught us that he ought to ſuppoſe they Did: For-<hi>Charity thinketh no evil,</hi> but <hi>hopeth All things, believeth All things:</hi> Since therefor <hi>This</hi> was much better than <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> and <hi>Willingly</hi> to affront our Lord in his <hi>Repreſentative;</hi> This muſt in Charity be ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Prudence</hi> agreed with <hi>Charity,</hi> rather to ſeek out <hi>Excuſes</hi> for them, than to expoſe them to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttermoſt.</hi> He was to deal as Sweetly and Obligingly as poſſibl, ſo to endear Himſelf and the Goſpel to them, Praiſe them as much as poſſibly he might, Reprove them no more than Needs he muſt, and Excuſe them when he could not Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them.</p>
               <p>And this as it ſweetened the Reproof in appearance; ſo did it more bitterly aggravate the Crime, if their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences upbraided them, as uncapabl of ſuch an excuſe: Since the Guilt muſt needs be Great, which to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover appeared Incredibl.</p>
               <p>Nor could any Inconvenience on the Other ſide diſſuade ſuch a procedure. This way he might meet with them at All turns: If they wer Really miſtaken, he might Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their Judgments; if they wer not, he might Baffl their Pretences, and Both waies Reprove their Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; reſcuing our Lords Supper from Profanation, if they intended to celebrate it, and his Commands from Neglect if they intended it not, and Himſelf from any appearance either of Severity towards Them, or Coldneſs towards our Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 3. <hi>HOW doth his Procedure ſuit with ſuch Suppoſals?</hi> If we carefully obſerve we find that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part agreeth very well with them, and the later part will agree with no other.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59001:54"/>
               <p>That he deſigned to treat them as Kindly as poſſibl, we may ſee in his entrance upon This Chapter: <hi>Now I praiſe you, brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them unto you:</hi> And again in his entrance upon this very Reproof, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, <hi>Now in This that I declare unto you, I praiſe you not, that you com together, not for the better, but for the worſ:</hi> And again by his cloſe upon his deſcription of their miſcarriages, <hi>verſ</hi> 22. <hi>What ſhall I ſay to you? Shall I praiſe you in This? I praiſe you not.</hi> How <hi>Unwillingly!</hi> How <hi>Gently!</hi> and (if his thoughts wer like ours) how <hi>Coldly,</hi> doth he put in this calm exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his late General <hi>Praiſe!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had in a caſe far leſs ſcandalos, ſaid, <hi>Now therefor there is utterly a falt among you:</hi> And ſpeaking of thoſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi> which are here alſo objected, as the firſt inſtance of their unworthy <hi>coming together,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I could not ſpeak unto you as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet here, when <hi>Diviſions</hi> of the <hi>Rich</hi> among Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their joint contemts of the <hi>Poor;</hi> their Shiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and Uncharitabl ſeparations, eating every <hi>one his Own ſupper,</hi> and deſtroying the very <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and their <hi>Intemperance</hi> in Thoſe Suppers, affronting not only our Lords Doctrine, but his very Perſon; when ſuch abuſes of his very <hi>Body and Bloud,</hi> in his <hi>Own Houſ,</hi> in the face of his <hi>Own Church,</hi> cryed to his utmoſt zele and eloquence for a Reproof loud as the Crime; in ſo clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros a provocation, what do we meet, but a cold Negative, much ſhort of <hi>Eli</hi>'s (however condemned) reproof? Not ſo much as his <hi>[This is no good report. You make the peopl to abhorr the table of the Lord]</hi> but only, <hi>[I praiſe you not.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall indeed hereafter find him lift up his now calm voice and loudly thunder both <hi>Reproofs</hi> and <hi>Threats,</hi> verſ 29. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body.</hi> But this, in conſequence of Conviction, which by That time he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59001:54"/> his argument to have wrought in them: After which, if they ſhould Willingly and Knowingly profane <hi>This Bread and This Cup,</hi> now proved to be the Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud; their Crime would be uncapable not only of Praiſe, but of Excuſe.</p>
               <p>The Gentl language therefore that Uſhereth in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, compared with the Severe, which Followeth it; doth more than intimate a ſuppoſal, that they knew not what they did; and therefor were firſt to be Convinced of their Error by good Evidence, and then Frighted with Threatnings, leſt they ſhould continu in the now <hi>inexcuſabl wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we may (perhaps) yet better underſtand his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Diſeaſe, by the Medicine he uſeth for its Cure; which is no other, but a re-minding them of what he had before Declared to them, and they (perhaps) miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood in This ſubject, wherin he ſeemeth thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpak them.</p>
               <p>I am loth to believ you guilty of ſo horrid a contemt of our Lords Perſon, as to drink his very Bloud, in a manner ſo ſhameful, as looketh more like the mockery of a contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melios Jew, than the devotion of a faithful Diſciple: No, I rather impute this to your Forgetfulneſs or Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of what I declared unto you concerning this moſt holy Ordinance; which therfor I now repete to you</p>
               <p>Then doth he proceed to recite the whole Inſtitution, ſo Particularly, as at That time he might very well think Sufficient throghly to convince them, in what he Suppoſed, or would ſeem to Suppoſe them, Miſtaken.</p>
               <p>I ſay it was at That time ſufficient. For it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we diſtinguiſh between That time and Our own. The Tradition where on we ſuppoſe our Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per founded, was Then not only in Memory, but in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. The Demonſtrative had its Object, not only Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibl, but Viſibl; they did not more plainly Hear the Word than See what it pointed at; and therfor our Lord might
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59001:55"/> well think it ſuperfluos to expreſs How Often they wer to do <hi>This in remembrance of himſelf,</hi> ſince the Tradition, which That very Inſtitution commended, ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Do This]</hi> ſaid he, <hi>[This]</hi> which you ſee Me do; <hi>[This]</hi> which your Whole Nation in ſuch circumſtances conſtantly do in conformity to the Tradition: Do <hi>[This]</hi> with the ſame Matter, <hi>Bread and Wine;</hi> In the ſame Order, <hi>Firſt Bread,</hi> and <hi>Then Wine;</hi> at the ſame Seaſon, <hi>After Supper;</hi> and (is it not equally plain?) with the ſame Frequency, when <hi>Three or More</hi> feſt together.</p>
               <p>This meſure of Frequency might our Lord well ſuppoſe at <hi>That time,</hi> in <hi>Thoſe circumſtances</hi> ſufficiently plain, by that known rule, <hi>Exceptio firmat legem in non exceptis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it ſeems the Diſciples wer either leſs Able, or leſs Willing to underſtand, than He had reaſon to expect: And how the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might miſtake, we have made not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable conjectures. The Apoſtl therefor, to Clear what now appeared to Need it, telleth them plainly, that what our Lord at the time of inſtitution did Not Expreſs, he had ſince Reveled to be his meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>as often as</hi> they drank <hi>That Cup,</hi> which he then conſecrated <hi>after Supper,</hi> they muſt do it <hi>in remembrance of himſelf.</hi> Since therfor they cloſed (or ought to cloſe) All their feſts with the Same Cup, his Bloud was concerned in them All.</p>
               <p>WHAT fairer account can poſſibly be deſired of this Former part of the Apoſtles Proceſs? Of the Lenity of his Reproof, of his Method in convincing them, firſt of their Error, and then of their Gvilt? Of his Reciteing the Lords inſtitution, ſo to vindicate his Supper from Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of his inſerting the omitted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo to aſſert the Intereſt that his Supper had in Their publick meetings, and of his authorizing this inſertion, ſo to avoid the objection that might be raiſed from our Saviors not uſeing it, proved by the joint teſtimony of the three Evangeliſts.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59001:55"/>
               <p>WHAT need the Apoſtl do More, than baffle All their Pretences, and rectifie All their Miſtakes? and what could he do Leſs, than prevent that moſt obvios Evaſion, whereby they might have pleaded for Thoſe Meetings, as unconcerned in the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>If any one of a contrary judgment can give a fairer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Former part of the Apoſtl's diſcourſ, he will do a Great work, but he will have a Greater yet to do: For the Later part, wherein the Apoſtl draweth his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, will not only Offer this as the Faireſt, but Urge it as the Only ſens of his argument.</p>
               <p n="5">V. LET us now therefor carefully examin HOW and WHAT he bildeth upon his ſo ſolen recital of our Lords Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>He beginneth his deductions at the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he reſumeth the Laſt as the moſt Important clauſe, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down as the Sum of our Lords mind in his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Foundation of all his own intended Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therefrom, that <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye ſhew forth our Lords death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By This Propoſition therefor muſt we meſur his Deſign: by This muſt we enquire, whether he intended merely to prove, that <hi>Reverence is due to the Lords Supper</hi> (as is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſed) or whether he mean to prove, that <hi>Some determinate Bread and Cup, was conſecrate by our Lord to his Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In This Inquiry we ſhall proceed. 1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Former cannot be his meaning. 2. Poſitively, ſhewing that the Later muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The FORMER cannot be: This will appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the Subject or the Praedicate of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The SUBJECT of the Propoſition, is not <hi>[the Lords Supper]</hi> but <hi>[This Bread and This Cup]</hi> and therefor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59001:56"/> whatever the Praedicate brings, muſt not belong to That but to Theſe.</p>
               <p>That the Lords Supper preciſely and formally conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not the true ſubject of the Propoſition, is plain, both by the expreſs words that have not a ſyllabl of it, and by plain reaſon, which requireth it to differ from the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate: For if the Subject differ from the Praedicate only in Syllables, not in ſenſe; the Propoſition will be no better than a tautology, a mere repetition of the ſame thing in other words.</p>
               <p>It is true, the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is concerned in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but Mediatly, becauſe of its intimate relation to <hi>This Bread and This Cup,</hi> which for its ſake, are advanced above All other of the kind, conſecrated firſt to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and thereby to his <hi>Body and Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And This is ſo much the more conſiderable: becauſe, if the Apoſtle had no other deſign, but only to aſſert the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of our <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> he ought in all reaſon to have inſiſted upon the very Phraſe, which would go far in his way.</p>
               <p>For the very <hi>Name of the Lord</hi> challengeth Reverence: the very Sound is an Argument, it carrieth Aurhority and Commandeth Aw into the hearts of the hearers: whereas on the contrary <hi>[Bread and Wine]</hi> in their natural State, are but poor beggarly creatures, ſervants of our Appetites at beſt, and too often of our Corruptions, and need a Law to defend them from our abuſes.</p>
               <p>Now that our Apoſtle ſhould have No other Deſign, but to aſſert the dignity of our <hi>[Lords Supper,]</hi> yet deſert that ſtile which would Strengthen his Argument, and take up another that would Weaken it; is ſo much the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, becauſe he had uſed That more potent ſtile in his charge, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and thereby obliged himſelf to inforce it: So that he muſt now deſert, not only the Reaſon of his Argument, but the very Subject of his Charge; if he had no other deſign in This Propoſition, but to prove
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59001:56"/> that our <hi>[Lords Supper]</hi> oght not to be treated as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The PRAEDICATE of This Propoſition is utterly uſeleſs, or worſe, to ſuch a deſign.</p>
               <p>The Argument would run more Clearly, more Briefly, and more Conveniently, Without the Propoſition than With it. For the Inſtitution having ſtiled this <hi>Suppor of the Lord</hi> his [BODY and BLOOD] the Inference is moſt Natural and Cogent, therefore <hi>whoever celebrateth the [Lords Supper] unworthily, is guilty of his [Body and Blood.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So this whole 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe</hi> will at beſt be but imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently troubleſom, good for nothing but to amuſe our thoughts, confound our minds, and cloud the light of the Argument.</p>
               <p>Yea, the very Phraſe of the Praedicate will conſpire with That of the Subject, not only to Darken the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to Weaken it. For to declare it our <hi>[Lords Body and Blood]</hi> muſt needs command our aw more, than to ſay it <hi>[ſetteth forth his death]</hi> ſo that the interpoſition of This meaner office, between our Lords Inſtitution and his own next Inference in <hi>verſe</hi> 27. in Both whereof That higher one is given it, can ſerv to no other effect, but to eclipſe the Light, and intercept the Influence, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would ſtream more powerfully and directly from the One to the Other.</p>
               <p>In a word: let the Otherwiſe minded ſhew what Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yea, what Uſe this 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe</hi> ſerveth; what Light, or what Strength it miniſtreth to the Diſcourſe: otherwiſe they muſt needs, either ſuppoſe the Apoſtle to talk imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, or accept of That ſervice which his words offer; which what it is will yet forther appear.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. POSITIVELY therefor: This Propoſition pointeth at ſome <hi>Determinate Bread and Cup,</hi> declaring, that Whoever eateth <hi>That determinate Bread,</hi> and drinketh
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59001:57"/> 
                  <hi>That determinate Cup,</hi> doth Thereby <hi>ſhew forth the Lords death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the lately diſputed Particle [THIS] is no Leſs, perhaps More conſiderable in the Apoſtl's mouth, than we found it in our Lord's: For the ſake of This Demonſtrative did he ſo ſolenly recite the Inſtitution, and reſume That as the moſt important clauſe therein: From This doth he derive All his Argument, and to This doth he pay All his Service.</p>
               <p>He obſerveth to what honor our Lord advanceth the <hi>Bread and Cup,</hi> From His hand doth he take them, cloaths them with the important Demonſtrative as the Robe royal, rendring them conſpicuoſly honorable in the beholders eyes, Crowns them with the potent <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as giving them power to preſcribe meſures to our obedience, leads them in pomp, and proclaims before them, THIS <hi>is the Bread,</hi> and THIS <hi>the cup which the Lord delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:</hi> THIS Bread and THIS Cup hath he commiſſioned to <hi>ſhew forth his death:</hi> THIS Bread and THIS Cup, are the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi> and therefor whoever <hi>eateth THIS Bread, and drinketh THIS Cup of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Proceſs is Pompos, yet withal it is Elegant: he ſo inculcateth the important particl, as to favor your ears: he ſo indeavoreth to ſatisfy, as not to ſurfeit you with nauſeos repetitions: and therefore having ſo ſhewed it, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to fill you with his meaning, he withdraweth by degrees, ſtill varying the phraſe, yet ſo, as ſtill to preſerv the influence, even when he quitteth the ſound of the Demonſtrative.</p>

                  </gap>, neither of which was given it in the Inſtitution: The reaſon will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non be plain; he now deſcribeth the complete Supper, wherein the Bread is no leſs neceſſary than the Cup, thogh not equally honored with it in the Inſtitution, as we ſhall ſee (and underſtand why) anon.</p>
               <p>In <hi>verſe</hi> 27. He keepeth the ſame ſtile for the Bread, but varieth it in the Cup; ſaith not now <hi>[THIS cup]</hi> but <hi>[The cup of the Lord.]</hi> And here we muſt pauſe, leſt we ſeem to contradict truth: for I ſaid but now, that the Apoſtl men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth not <hi>[the Lords Supper]</hi> whereas here he ſtileth the Cup <hi>[the cup of the Lord.]</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>verſe,</hi> wherein he cut out work for his whole following proceſs. Again, in this very <hi>verſe</hi> 27. it is yoked with <hi>[This Bread]</hi> and being thus ſecured from any danger of miſtake, might ſafely be clothed with That larger title, more ſuitable for It than for the Bread; becauſe it doth not only Repreſent his Blood, as the Bread doth his Body, but Preſcribe the frequeny for celebration, which the Bread doth Not.</p>
               <p>In <hi>verſe</hi> 28. The Demonſtrative is laid aſide: and in the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, not only the Demonſtrative, but the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. In both, a manifeſt Ellipſis, eaſily and neceſſarily ſupplied: ſince we cannot apprehend the Action of Eating
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59001:58"/> and Drinking, without the Bread and Cup, nor any other Bread and Cup but only THIS, ſo earneſtly inculcated in the ſame breath.</p>
               <p>And now that I may bring the whole Argument to a cloſer vieu, I ſhall from a disjointed examination of its ſcattered parts, proceed to a reduction of All to Logik form, in a Syllogiſm of the moſt perfect mode.</p>
               <p>Bar- <hi>As often as you ſhew forth the Lords death unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, you are guilty of his Body and Blood.</hi>

               <p>The Concluſion thence inferred, <hi>verſe</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>But the Propoſition (which is generally look'd upon as the adaequate deſign) the Apoſtle no otherwiſe proveth, but by reciting the Inſtitution, which abundantly declareth the relation between the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and <hi>his Body and Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefor it was neceſſary for him to convince them, that the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was concerned in All their meetings, but not at all, that the <hi>Lords Body and Blood</hi> were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in his Supper; ſince accordingly, he payeth All his ſervice to [This Bread and This Cup] which was uſed in all their Meetings, but None at all to the [Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per] otherwiſe then by conſequence therefrom: Since the whole 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe</hi> muſt be utterly Impertinent, and worſe, if it pretend only to aſſert the dignity of the [Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per] but moſt Cogent, if it intend to aſſert that of [This Bread and This Cup] ſince One way, he ſhall prove a truth, whoſe importance Deſerved his ſervice, and whoſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59001:58"/> Doubtfulneſs Needed it; and the Other way one, who's Self-evidence ſuperſeded any Proof; one might think the choice between them not very doubtful.</p>
               <p>Yet, ar we all this while no farther than the Entry: For the very Life of the Argument is laid up in a Clauſe, purpoſely inſerted in the Cloſe of our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> and reſumed in the Head of his Own diſcourſe, as the ſtrength of the whole; yet ſo miſerably miſtaken, that it is made the only Enemy to the Apoſtl's direct deſign; Diſpenſing with the Conſtancy, which he ſo induſtrioſly laboreth to prove Indiſpenſibl.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HOW unhappy our <hi>Lords Supper</hi> hath be'n in All the means he uſed to indear it, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy noted. He choſe the Laſt night, becauſe the words of dying friends moſt forcibly affect the ſurvivors: and the horrors of the Tragical time daſhed it out of the Apoſtl's thoghts. He then made a contrary opportunity, and by a Supper purpoſely contrived, evidenced his care of This memorial of his Death, equal to that of evidencing his Reſurrection: And then, Joy and Wonder hindred them more from heeding This, than from believing That: Nor did Any other means prevail, till the Holy Ghoſt broght it to their underſtandings.</p>
               <p>But their Diſciples had not the ſame meſur of This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> either miſtook or ſoon forgot; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> found it highly neceſſary not only to Remind them of their duty, but further to Explain it.</p>
               <p>And This very Explication ſuffers as much from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of Interpreters, as did the Holy Supper it ſelf, from the profaneneſs of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For St. <hi>Paul</hi> did no more intend to diſcorage our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Lords Command, than did our Lord himſelf, to encourage Their profaneneſs in the Performance.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59001:59"/>
               <p>Yet in his Own words do we take refuge from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, as if he had taught us to place All our ſafety from Unworthineſs, in keeping diſtance from Obedience.</p>
               <p>That we ſhould run from One extreme to a Contrary, thogh it be a great Error, is no great Wonder: thogh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be more Condemned, yet nothing is more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed.</p>
               <p>But that Thoſe very words, whereby he indeavored to Prevent the Error, ſhould be made to Serv it; That he ſhould uſe his utmoſt care to prove Conſtancy indiſpenſibl, and we ſhould take his words for a Diſpenſation from it: is the Singular unhappineſs of This Only clauſe, perverted thereby to an utter Defaiſance of our Lords Command, and an utter Defait of his Own Deſign.</p>
               <p>We ſhall therefor indevor to reſtore the Words to their due power.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by ſhewing what muſt needs be their true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ang: And Secundly, by expoſing the Abſurdities of That, which is vulgarly impoſed upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. FIRST, we are to enquire into the true ſenſe of this Clauſe <hi>[As often as.]</hi> And to this end we need not look back upon what we have ſeen in the word [THIS] For, This Clauſ no leſs peremtorily requireth a certain Standard, than That Demonſtrative doth a certain Object: And the Apoſtle plainly joineth them together in the ſame power, as the dubl hinge whereon his whole Argument turneth.</p>
               <p>Theſe doth he jointly reſume as the ſum of our Lords inſtitution; Theſe doth he <hi>faſten as a nail in a ſure place,</hi> and upon Theſe doth he hang that chain of Conſequences, whereby he convinceth his <hi>Corinthians</hi> of their crime, and diſcovereth the Need and Way to avoid it.</p>
               <p>Let us firſt vieu the import of the Words, and Then his care concerning them.</p>
               <p>This <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is plainly <hi>Relative:</hi> it imports Equality in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59001:60"/> point of Frequency, and requireth that the new Relative ſhould conform it ſelf to the meſur of a Former Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate.</p>
               <p>Now it is plain, that whoever is obliged to make One thing Equal to Another, muſt certainly know the meſur of That Other, which he is to conform to. No Town can ſhew a Standard made of Air or Water, but of Wood or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, whoſe firm ſubſtance having a ſtable bigneſs of its own, may certainly determin the Quantity of what is to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtl is very careful to prove and inculcate, that <hi>[Eating THIS bread and drinking THIS cup]</hi> is the ſtable Standard whereby we muſt meſure our Frequency in the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> It muſt therefor be neceſſary, that it ſelf muſt have its Determined Frequency, fixed by ſom prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vios Law or Cuſtom certainly foreknown, and thereby ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to give meſures to any Other performance.</p>
               <p>If therefor <hi>[THIS bread and THIS cup]</hi> be (as I hope I have proved) a <hi>Singular bread and cup,</hi> uſed at Certain Determinate times, then have we the Standard whereby we muſt meſure our Frequency in the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> And again, if we are obliged to do This <hi>[As often as]</hi> That; then muſt we underſtand how often we muſt Do That. So the Relation is perfect and reciprocal. Our obligation to celebrate the <hi>Lords Supper [As often as we Eat THIS,</hi> &amp;c.] ſuppoſeth it certain <hi>[how often]</hi> we eat it: And the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of difference between <hi>THIS and Other bread and wine,</hi> determineth how often we are to uſe Them in the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus will our Lords mind in This Inſtitution, be as plain as in Any other Practical Precept; The Apoſtles Argument as convincing as Any in All his Epiſtles; And our Lord's ſtile, conformable to that of All mankind, and that which himſelf frequently uſed, when moſt deſiros to be underſtood by the meaneſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When th u faſteſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>anoint thy head and waſh thy
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59001:60"/> face: when thou giveſt thine alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth: When ye Pray, ſay Our Fasher,</hi> &amp;c. Had theſe exerciſes no other Foundation, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carioſly ſuppoſed Will of the performer; and That too, undrawn by any preceding motive: Had they never before be'n heard of in the World (as is ſuppoſed of <hi>This bread and This cup)</hi> what would ſuch a groundleſs Precept have ſignified? Who wold thereby have be'n induced to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the penance of Faſting, the coſt of Alms-doing, or the labor of Prayer? Or what Obligation had there be'n broken by the neglect?</p>
               <p>Whereas now, that theſe Precepts did not Create New performances, but Reform Old ones; ſince, before our Lord had opened his lips concerning them, his Diſciples very well knew how frequently Thoſe exerciſes were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it muſt be needleſs to tell them what they knew already; but he muſt be ſuppoſed to imply it in what he bilt upon it.</p>
               <p>And if we may paraphraſe his words, we may thus do it: <hi>You often Faſt, and give Alms, and Pray, and ye do well in it: I give you no new command concerning the Subſtance or Quantity of thoſe good exerciſes; go on to do as much as you have formerly do'n; but I caution you concerning the Manner, that</hi> as often <hi>as you do them, you do them ſincerely without any miſture of Hypocriſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The language is the very ſame here, and ſo ar all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; A practice preſuppoſed, and left to its former me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, a new Precept concerning a change of manner, and This meſured in point of frequency by the foreknown Standard: Our Lord's and the Apoſtl's meanings, as clear at That time, as the ſuppoſed practice (they both refer to) was common. I ſay [At That time] and inſiſt upon it, as neceſſary both for Juſtification of the Scriptur, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our Own Conſciences, that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem That time, that therewith we may retrive the Only proper light, whereby we may diſcover both
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59001:61"/> our Lord's and Apoſtl's meaning.</p>
               <p>And thogh we might now ſuperſede any further proof, ſince our Lord himſelf may be pleaded the beſt Interpreter of his own Language, frequently uſed upon like occaſions; yet becauſe another and more acceptabl ſens (ſhall I call it) hath gotten poſſeſſion of Moſt, if not of All minds: I ſhall further obſerv,

               <p n="3">III. 1. IT is very obſervable with what care the Apoſtle Recordeth this clauſe. None of the Evangeliſts mention it, and it is probable our Lord uſed it not in his Inſtitution; and therefor the Apoſtle is careful ſo to Inſert it, as withal to Authoriſe it, ſaying expreſly, That <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceved it of the Lord.</hi> This is very conſiderable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for we ſhall obſerv,</p>

               <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi> (indeed) is very ſparing (as became an abridger) in recording ſuch Revelations: he mentions only That which converted him, and a very few others, relating to ſom of his journies: Yet in recital of his ſpeech to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> he plainly intimateth a larger diſcourſe even in That Firſt Viſion, than himſelf had expreſſed; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that our Lord promiſed to make That an earneſt of More, and Thoſe more inſtructive: <hi>I have</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>appeared unto thee for This purpoſe, to make thee a Miniſter and a Witneſs both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of Thoſe things wherein I will appear unto thee.</hi>

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59001:61"/>
               <p>Which After-appearances were Such and ſo Many, that he declareth himſelf in danger of being puffed up by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What he declareth himſelf to <hi>have receved of the Lord,</hi> muſt needs be This conſiderabl <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>All the reſt were openly delivered at the Inſtitution, to the whole College of Apoſtles; from Them he might have receved them, and to their Teſtimony he might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peled, if his truth had be'n queſtioned.</p>
               <p>But concerning Theſe important words, they muſt All have joined their teſtimony Againſt him, if the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts did not join in a ſtrange omiſſion, neglecting to report ſuch a conſiderable clauſe.</p>
               <p>As therefor our Lord by a very intelligible Ellipſis, left theſe words unſpoken, becauſe needleſs at the time of his Inſtitution; ſo doth the Apoſtle now by another Ellipſis, omit the diſtinction which we are ſuppoſed to underſtand, between This clauſe which he inſerted, as receved of the Lord by a poſthum explication, and the reſt, which All the other Apoſtles receved without it, at his Laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe words alone he immediatly reſumeth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth as his principal Evidence, for all his deductions thence inferred.</p>
               <p>Since this is the Baſis of All, it oght to be firmly ſetled, and he needed our Lords authority for This only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Authority evidenceth not Only the Truth, but the Importance of what was thus delivered.</p>
               <p>Theſe words of deference <hi>[What I have receved]</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paid but to Truths of the firſt rate.</p>
               <p>In the fundamental Article of the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, &amp;c. when he had honored it with the moſt illuſtrios titles, <hi>The Goſpel, That whereby we are to be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. he addeth This alſo: <hi>I have delivered</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>[that which I alſo receved]</hi> but expreſſeth not from whom; ſince the <hi>cloud of witneſſes</hi> was apparent.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59001:62"/>
               <p>When he would confirm the truth of the whole Goſpel, and exalt its dignity to the higheſt, he ſpeaketh in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtile, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11. <hi>I receved it not of man, neither was I taught it, but by Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince the Stile is the ſame, the Conſequence muſt be the ſame, Here as There: <hi>If I, or an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, teach any other doctrin than what you have received, let him be accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When our Lord himſelf hath ſo reveled his mind, All the inhabitants of Earth and Heaven ſhould they combine, are nether to be believed againſt the Revelation, nor obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Command.</p>
               <p>And to what purpoſe ſuch a Revelation, and ſuch a Vouching? If Theſe words do not Streighten the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will be but Impertinent; if they Slacken it, they will be Worſe. They can no other way anſwer the Care beſtowed upon them, but by inforcing conſtancy in the performance.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 2. MY next Obſervation is, the Partiality where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Apoſtle treateth the Cup, which alone is honored with theſe conſiderable words. Somthing of This Partiality we have already obſerved in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Cup of Devils, which added to what we are now conſidering, will duble the weight.</p>
               <p>Deſcribing the Inſtitution, he giveth the Bread its due Place, but as cold a Treat as poſſible. Affordeth it not ſo much as the common articl, but without welt or gard, ſpeaketh in the ſlighteſt manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth our Lord as equally ſlighting it, not ſtiling it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, but Indefinitely <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: much leſs giving it the power to meſur the performance.</p>
               <p>But coming to the Cup, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. He uſeth it with much more deference himſelf, and reporteth our Lord to have uſed the ſame Partiality. He ſaith (indeed) that our Lord took the Cup <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: But the Equality muſt relate to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59001:62"/> the Tradition which it equally honored, not to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances wherewith it ſelf was honored, not in Like, but in Higher manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He expreſſeth the exact Seaſon <hi>[After Supper]</hi> and This in exact conformity to the Jewiſh ſtile, which uſeth to fix a character of emphaſis upon the Cup After Supper: As we find moſt properly to our purpoſe, <hi>Berach.</hi> cap. 7. ver. 6. <hi>Wine is broght to them in the midl of the meal, they bleſs ſeverally every one by himſelf:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>For That After meal, one bleſſeth for them all.</hi> Where that prefix ל payeth deference the Wine After Supper as to Wine of note. But this is not payed to Bread, becauſe none but the Paſchal Cake was diſtributed After Supper; and had our Apoſtle ſpoken of That in the ſame ſtile, he had intimated that which he endeavoreth to confute, <hi>viz.</hi> that our <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was ſucceſſor to the Paſſover.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He honoreth it with an emphatical Article, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then he deſcribeth our Lords partiality, who did not ſpeak of it as of the Bread, with a ſimpl <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but more emphatically, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor Indefinitely <hi>[This is my blood;]</hi> as of the Bread <hi>[This is my body]</hi> but with an Explication, fixing his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>[This is the New Teſtament in my blood.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And above All; the important <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is induſtrioſly put upon the Cup, and denied to the Bread.</p>
               <p>Let us now reflect.</p>
               <p>He Firſt reciteth the conſecration of the Bread: and he could no otherwiſe: matter of fact obliged him to it, as appeareth by the uniform teſtimony of all the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts which ſpake any thing of it. Yet he prefaceth the conſecration of the Cup with the note of conformity <hi>[In like manner alſo.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which form of ſpeaking, it is Not unuſual to omit in reciting the later, what had be'n expreſſed in the former; the very phraſe excuſing, becauſe manifeſting the Ellipſis,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59001:63"/> uſed merely to avoid the tedioſneſs of repetition.</p>
               <p>But it is contrary both to Reaſon and Practice, that any thing ſhould be omitted in the Former, and underſtood in the Later; and therein expreſſed by ſuch a conforming Phraſe, when This cannot find in That any likeneſs.</p>
               <p>What the Reaſon of this ſtrange method is, we ſhall the better diſcover, if we obſerv Another care which ſeemeth to croſs This.</p>
               <p>He is very punctual in reciting the difference of Time, between the conſecration of the One and the Other. Our Lord took the Bread <hi>[when he had given thanks]</hi> and the Cup <hi>[when he had ſupped.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Argument wold have go'n more Smoothly, thogh not ſo Strongly, if in the common way of ſpeaking he had made the later every way like the former. But how could he avoid this croſs?</p>
               <p>Should he give the Cup the precedence? he muſt then miſreport matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>Should he then apply theſe meſuring words to the Bread, that he might ſpeak of the Cup in like manner alſo? He muſt then have confounded his Own argument: For the meſuring clauſe muſt have ſignified either too much or too little: too little, if this ſhould point at the Paſchal Bread; too much, if to the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>For ſince, of All Feſts, the Paſſover was moſt prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of our <hi>Lords Death,</hi> and he delivered rhe Bread with ſuch a form of words, as manifeſtly alluded to the <hi>Paſchal cake;</hi> if to ſuch peculiar ſuitableneſs with That Seaſon, and That Form, he had added Theſe words alſo; Would not the Demonſtrative have pointed to the Bread, as Paſchal? and conſequently, would not theſe words have required us to meſure our performance of the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by that of God to <hi>Moſes?</hi> And would not this have cleared the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from any profanation of his Supper, except only in the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Communion?</p>
               <p>But if theſe words had be'n applied to the Bread, as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59001:63"/> bleſſed Before Supper, then muſt they have ſignified too much: For they would have comprehended, not only every Feſt, but every Private meal. They would not be a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brike for Publik worſhip in the Church, but Advice for Private manners at home, they would neither require Feſt nor Communion, nor diſtinguiſh the Church of God from the meaneſt Parlor.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly to Prevent, certainly to Remove both ſides of miſtake, and to convince the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to cloſe neither All their Private, nor Only their Paſchal, but All and Only their Feſtival Suppers with our Lords: he So deſcribeth the Inſtitution, that it appeareth probable, that our Lord diſtributed the Bread at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and more ſo, that he did it before the <hi>End of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi> but manifeſt, that the Cup he delivered at its proper time: And ſince the Cup was the Adaequate character of a Feſt, to the Cup only muſt the power be given, which theſe words import.</p>
               <p>Let Any one giv Any other tolerabl account why the Apoſtl ſhould thus deprive the Firſt-born of the Bleſſing which naturally belongs to it, and I muſt confeſs my ſelf to have loſt a great evidence of the Relation between our Lords Inſtitution, and the Tradition whence I endevor to prove it derived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are too many who have need to conſider another honor to which our Lord preferred the Cup above the Bread. He ſaid not, Eat ye [All] but ſaid, Drink ye [All] of this: Whether This difference wer occaſioned by</hi> Judas<hi>'s Preſence when That was distributed, and his Abſence when this was ſo, is not ſo plain as it is, that it falleth very croſs to the Laws of That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church, which denying the people the Cup; takes away the better half of our Lords Supper, and the Whole of the Apoſtl's Argument, which cannot out-live this loſe, but would not have be'n wounded ſo mortally by That of the Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59001:64"/>V. 3. MY laſt remark is, that in the Deductions which which himſelf draweth from our Lords purpoſly recited Inſtitution, he payeth to the Bread joint honor with the Cup, which he had denied it for no other reaſon, but only for its unſerviceableneſs to his Argument.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Deductions ar uſhered with <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he com.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Here we ſee he applieth Theſe relative words to Both elements, whereas in recital of our Lords Inſtitution, he had not at all applied them to the Bread: And this, contrary to that know'n rule, which forbids the <hi>Concluſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more than was conteined in the Premiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereof what other account can there be given, or what better deſired, than the Tradition offereth? In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>verſe</hi> he was to ſtate our Lords mind reveled to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, concerning Frequency: And thereof the Cup was the only Standard, becauſe That alone diſtinguiſhed Feſtival Suppers from Common: But in This he is to deſcribe the Supper it ſelf, wherein the Bread hath right, not only to be joined with it, but to be preferred before it.</p>
               <p>Had he now excluded the Bread, he muſt have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning It, what ſom, without any ſuch color, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare concerning the Cup; that it were needleſs, bicauſe the Supper were complete without it: But by this care, he preventeth any ſuch concept.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He addeth another Claus, not mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>['till he com]</hi> thereby either to obviate an evaſion in point of Duration, if poſſibly the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might pretend to ſhift from his reproofs, by ſuppoſing the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation worn out; or to ſtrengthen the command, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how great eſteem our Lord had for it, as extending it to all times future as well as preſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the moſt remarkable is this, that the Imperative is changed to the Indicative: A change ſo Conſiderable, and otherwiſe ſo unaccountable, that our glorios Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59001:64"/> thinketh it not to be made. The Greek is indifferent to both; but in the Imperative there appeared a grain of ſenſe, and none at all in the Indicative.</p>
               <p>For if in the Subject of the Indicative propoſition, we ſee no other difference between. This Bread and Cup, and and any Other Bread and Cup, but what our own actual Conſecration hath advanced it to; if this ſtile be only a Periphraſe of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> differing therefrom only in Syllables, then will the Propoſition tell us no news at all: Every child will without its help underſtand, that <hi>as often as we eat.</hi> This bread and drink This cup (upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon but this, that we may thereby <hi>ſhew forth our Lords death) we ſhew forth our Lords death.</hi> And that the Apoſtl ſhould ſo carefully bring a candl to ſhew us the Sun, ſeemed no way probable to our learned Doctor.</p>
               <p>But if the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be read Imperatively, not <hi>[ye do]</hi> but <hi>[do ye]</hi> then may there be ſo much of reaſon in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as there is of poſſibility to do otherwiſe. For look how much danger there is, that we may do this without <hi>ſhewing forth our Lords death,</hi> juſt ſo much need there is of Caution, and juſt ſo much reaſon will there be in the Command, which hath no other uſe but to prevent ſuch danger: whereas in the Indicative, as there can be no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of error (ſince the very naming of the Subject makes the Praedicate ſelf-evident) ſo can there be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Yet all this while, if there be Any at all, there can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut a very ſmall difference: for the Performance contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the End, almoſt as neceſſarily as the Subject doth the Praedicate: it is almoſt as hard to <hi>do this</hi> without <hi>ſhewing forth our Lords death,</hi> as it is to doubt whether we oght to do it or no: And all that can be gotten by the change is this, that upon ſuppoſition of the Reverence which every one will certainly pay our Lords Perſon; the command en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining an action in remembrance of our Lords death, will by conſequence mind them of doing it with ſuch Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59001:65"/>
               <p>But be the gain litle or great, we muſt quit it: becauſe the word FOR which uſhereth the declaration, neceſſarily requireth the <hi>Indicative mode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had it be'n an Illative <hi>[wherefor</hi> or <hi>therefor]</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I ſay it is but a <hi>ſuppoſed Solaeciſm in Logik,</hi> and That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is grounded upon our inadvertency. For grant once that our Demonſtrative <hi>[This,]</hi> and our Relative <gap reason="foreign">

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> The Diſtinction between Suppoſitive and Abſolute ſtated, becauſe made the meſure of obligation. <hi>II.</hi> The words of the Author ſet forth, and <hi>III.</hi> Examined. <hi>IV.</hi> The merely ſuppoſitive ſens enervates our Lords Command. And <hi>V.</hi> The Apoſtl's own Argument. <hi>VI.</hi> The two ſenſes bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced in order to Conſcience.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT in ſo doing I may eſcape both the Task of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a tolerable countenance upon an opinion ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receved, and the Suſpicion of repreſenting it diſadvantageoſly; I conceve it moſt Convenient, if not abſolutely Neceſſary, to exhibit it in the words of its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons — Patron I ſhould ſay: For among the Many that entertein it, I know but One that hath put himſelf to the charge of affording it any means of Subſiſtence, by cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with any proper Rules, or nouriſhing it with any Proofs.</p>
               <p>But it is Such an One as may paſs for a Multitude: One, that may not be named without Reverence; One, of the greateſt Ornaments and Pillars of our Church; One, who profeſſeth to fit every ſubject with its proper Rules and Meſures; and therefor One, whom we may believe to have ſaid the utmoſt in behalf of his Opinion.</p>
               <p>This ſingular Perſon puts it to the queſtion, <hi>Whether our Lords words in This Inſtitution amount to a Command?</hi> And thogh his intereſt perſuaded him to have Affirmed it; yet the ſound of Theſe words, and inadvertency to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom we ſuppoſe them to relate to, engaging him for the Negative, embarraſed him in difficulties inextricable; from which, becauſe he ſtruggles to free himſelf by help
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59001:67"/> of the diſtinction between <hi>Suppoſitive</hi> and <hi>Abſolute;</hi> I ſhall firſt ſtate That diſtinction, and Then try what ſervice it can do in the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>A Suppoſitive Command Obligeth, juſt ſo as a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Propoſition Declareth, viz. nothing elſe but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion or Disjunction between the Parts.</p>
               <p>An Abſolute Propoſition may be true, though its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject have no Being: and ſo may an Hypothetical one, though its Antecedent have no Truth. And as a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Syllogiſm, Abſolutely concludes Nothing without help of an Abſolute Aſſumtion; ſo doth not a Hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Command oblige to any thing, without the help of ſom Poſitive addition: Hypothetical neceſſity is therefor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Abſolute liberty, becauſe the Obligation muſt derive half its power from the yet undetermined Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E. G.</hi> If my Father ſhould have laid upon me this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive Command, <hi>[As often as you go to</hi> London, <hi>go by land]</hi> This would not oblige me either to the Journy, or the Manner. By ſtaying at home I ſhould have be'n as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, as by a hundred tedios Journies. But if my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations or Biſineſs ſhould call me to the Journy; then, by vertu of the Command, joined with the Urgency of my Buſineſs, wer I obliged to go, not by Water but by Land.</p>
               <p>Such a Command would by no means have amounted to <hi>[Get you a horſ, and away.]</hi> Nor can a Suppoſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand amount to ſuch an Abſolute Precept, as <hi>[Let a man examin himſelf, and ſo let him eat.]</hi> But the utmoſt that ſo civil a word could amount to, is this, <hi>[If you are pleaſed to eat, then is it neceſſary you examin your ſelf.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the true ſtate of a Suppoſitive Obligation: It leaveth us at full liberty, thogh it expoſe us to be rob'd of it, by ſom Abſolute Propoſition following.</p>
               <p>And how impoſſibl it is to reconcile the Wiſdom of our Lords Inſtitution, with the Weakneſs of ſuch an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59001:67"/> cannot better be diſcovered, than by the ſucceſleſs attemts of ſo habile an Undertaker, whoſe words I com now to examin: wherein I beg the Readers juſt charity to believ (what I moſt ſerioſly proteſt) that it is not without great reluctancy, I engage in ſo unwelcom an office toward a perſon to whom I am ſo much obliged: and nothing but faithfulneſs to ſo great a Subject, ſhould compel me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the words of him whom all good men are obliged to honor.</p>
               <p>His Rule is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Inſtitution of a Rite or Sacrament by our Bleſſed Savior, is a direct Law, and paſſes a proper obligation in its whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This one would think is as plain as heart can wiſh, but the Gloſs quite mars the Text: for thus doth he endeavor to bend his Rule to his Conceptions, and Other Writings, concerning This Holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIS Rule can relate but to one inſtance, that of the Holy Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood; for although Chriſt did inſtitute two Sacraments, yet that of Baptiſm was under the form of an expreſs Commandment, and therefor for its obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation needs not the auxiliaries of This Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in the other Sacrament, the Inſtitution was by Actions, and intimations of duty and relative precepts, and ſuppoſitions of action, as</hi> quoties feceritis, <hi>and the like. Now whether this do amount to a Commandment or no, is the enquiry; and though the queſtion about the half Communion be otherwiſe determinable, yet by no Inſtrument ſo certain and immediate as this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In order therefor to the Rule of Conſcience in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I conſider, that an Inſtitution of a thing or ſtate of life by God, and by his Chriſt, is to be diſtinguiſhed from the manner of that thing ſo Inſtituted. When a thing is Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, it do's not equal an univerſal Commandment, but obtains the force of a Precept according to the ſubject matter,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59001:68"/> and to its appendant relations. Thus when God Inſtituted Marriage, he did not by that Inſtitution oblige every ſingle perſon to marry; for ſome were Eunuchs from their mothers wombs, and ſome were made Eunuchs by men, and ſome make themſelves Eunuchs for religious and ſevere ends, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a retirement and an untroubled life. But by this Inſtitution</hi> (ſay the Doctors of the Jews) <hi>every man was at firſt obliged, und ſo they are ſtill, if they have natural needs or natural tentations. But becauſe the Inſtitution was relative to the publik neceſſities of mankind, and the perſonal needs of a man, therefore it was not an univerſal or unlimited Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandmene, but only ſo far as it did miniſter to the neceſſary end, ſo far it was a neceſſary Commandment. It was not Inſtituted for Eunuchs; but for whom it was Inſtituted, to them it was a remedy againſt ſin, and the ſupport of the World, and the original of Families, and the ſeminary of the Church, and the endearment of Friendſhips, and the parent of Societies; and until the neceſſities of the World were abated, and the needs of ſingle perſons were diverted, or broken in pieces by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline of a new Inſtitution, it was eſteemed infamous, and it was puniſhable not to marry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>But then if we conſider the manner of this thing ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, it is certainly a perfect, unalterable, and univerſal Commandment. For although every man in every circumſtance be not by vertue of the Inſtitution obliged to marry; yet if he do's marry, by the Inſtitution he is tyed up ſtrictly, that at no hand he muſt praevaricate the meſures and limits of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, He that marries, must marry by that Rule and no other. He muſt marry one woman only while ſhe is alive: he muſt leave father and mother and adhere to her; he muſt treat her with charity and honor; he muſt uſe her by the limits of Nature and Sobriety; he muſt make her the Mother of his Family; he muſt make her ſerve no deſire but what is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and ſo in every thing is he limited to the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59001:68"/>
               <p>Then after a Paragraph ſpent in a critical account of the word <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> wherein nothing ſo much concerns our preſent enquiry, as a word (to his purpoſe unhappily) dropt, that <hi>Inſtitution does not directly ſignifie a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it ſuppoſes the perſons obliged; only it ſuperads the manner and meſures of diſobedience,</hi> which is as much as I pretend to: he thus ſums up his opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And thus it is in the matter of the Sacrament, as it is in the matter of Marriage. All men are not always obliged to receve the Sacrament; for the Inſtitution of it being in order to certain ends, and in the Recipients, certain capacities and condicions required by way of diſpoſition, there can be but a relative, and therefore a limited Commandment of its rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: but to them who receve it, the Inſtitution is a perfect indiſpenſible Commandment for the manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O the miſery of ſlavery to an Opinion! <hi>Quantum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus ab illo!</hi> How unlike himſelf in his other Works, is this admirable Perſon, when he attemts to reduce That O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to rules and meſures, which cannot conſiſt with Any! But let us follow him ſtep by ſtep.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>BY Actions]</hi> No, not by naked Actions, but by Actions with their <hi>lemmata,</hi> declaring their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Such Actions as thoſe of <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> who ſaid '<hi>As ye ſee me do, ſo do ye:</hi> Actions which made the words of command, not the Leſs, but the More ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Intimations of Duty]</hi> Intimation and Duty are no equal correlates: As expreſs words of the Imperative mood, import more then Intimation; ſo is Duty more then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation can inforce. If our Saviors modeſty was ſo great, or his authority ſo litle, that he did not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but Intimate; we may comply in Kindneſs, but need not obey in Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Relative Precepts]</hi> muſt have a Foundation, and ſo muſt</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59001:69"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suppoſitions of Actions]</hi> otherwiſe, they are not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Suppoſitions, but groundleſs Imaginations:</p>
               <p>As <hi>quoties feceritis.]</hi> But where is the ground for any <hi>[feceritis]</hi> at all? Doth any man act without competent reaſon? he acteth not like a man: Doth any man ſuppoſe another will act ſo? yea, Doth any man ſuppoſe that Ages and Nations will act ſo? and that, as of duty? He betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own want of Reaſon, by ſuppoſing it in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the like]</hi> The like What? this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſure was added merely for ſhew; and it ſheweth no more but this, that ſomthing more needed to have be'n ſaid, could we have knowen what. For all that hath yet be'n ſaid, reſteth at laſt upon a groundleſs Suppoſition, which thogh inlarged 'till it <hi>cover the face of the whole earth,</hi> will ſtill be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable <hi>as water,</hi> not able to afford the good Dove footing, or ſo much as an Olive-leaf toward ſatisfaction of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in our great enquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is in the matter of the Sacrament, as in the matter of Marriage]</hi> True, as to the relation between the State, and the Obligation conſequent thereupon: For as every one that entereth into That State, is obliged to all the Duties which It requireth; ſo is every one that receveth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, obliged to do it in due manner.</p>
               <p>But is it not in This as in That, as to the Suppoſition of the Action it ſelf, which is owned for the whole reaſon of the Obligation. For there is the firmeſt ground in the World whereon to bild a Suppoſition, that Many will do That, to which All are drawn by ſtrong Inclination, and Moſt by Neceſſity. For however uneaſie the yoke be, yet to Moſt it is not ſo galling as that of Eunuchiſm: Of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage therefor, Nature it ſelf hath made the Suppoſition, which ſtandeth like the Earth, firm upon its own mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm.</p>
               <p>But what Pole? what Center? what Natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? what Rational Motive? what Divine Command?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59001:69"/> what other Reaſon, antecedent to this Inſtitution, doth this Suppoſition hang upon?</p>
               <p>When it appeareth that men have as ſtrong a propenſity to This <hi>[feceritis]</hi> as to That, then will it appear, that it is in this mater as in That: but 'till Then, the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and conſequently the Inſtitutions built upon them, will differ as much as a Caſtel in the Air, and a Caſtel upon a Rock.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I could deny that <hi>[it is in the mater of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in the mater of Marriage]</hi> in This unhappy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; That Many frighted with the troubles of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate, refuſe to engage in it; and More, frighted with the difficulty of coming worthily, and the danger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unworthily, refuſe to com to This.</p>
               <p>But then in this reſpect again <hi>[it is Not in the mater of this Sacrament, as in that of Marriage]</hi> for when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples ſaid, <hi>If the mater be thus with a wife, it is not good to marry:</hi> our Lord granted the conſequence, and adviſed thoſe that could receve Eunuchiſm ſhould receve it. But we never find our Lord, or any Apoſt'l, ſay of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>He that cannot receve it worthily, let him forbear it;</hi> nor did our Apoſt'l cloſe his ſevere threats with ſaying, <hi>Let a man examin himſelf, and ſo if he find himſelf unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, let him forbear.</hi> But in both the one and the other without any <hi>[if]</hi> abſolutely oblige us to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All men are not Alway obliged to receve the Sacrament]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is very modeſtly, but withal very warily and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed: for had he ſpoken all, he muſt have marred all: his rule would have inferred <hi>[no man is at any time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged.]</hi> For mere ſuppoſitive neceſſity is on all hands agreed to be perfect liberty: ſince a counter-ſuppoſition in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcale, equally true, by counter-poiſing annihilates its weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Inſtitution being in order to certain ends, and in the recipients certain capacities and condicions required by way of diſpoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59001:70"/>
               <p>The excellent perſon had ſaid, 11. 2. <hi>An Inſtitution obtains the force of a Precept according to the ſubject matter, and to its appendent relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let that Rule be tranſlated hither, we need ſeek no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an anſwer. For the End of This Inſtitution is ſuch as All men at All times are obliged to ſerve; and by the laſt recited clauſe it will follow, rhat this muſt be ſo far a Neceſſary Commandment, as to remember our Lords death is a Neceſſary Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certain capacities and condicions are required]</hi> They are ſo, and that not only in order to the Sacrament, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and by their intrinſik neceſſity. It is our Duty firſt to have them, becauſe the Goſpel, upon other indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accounts, requires them: and then it is our duty to bring them to the Sacrament, even by this <hi>excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons own rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we will ſpeak diſtinctly, Natural capacities are not Required but Suppoſed; and as Marriage was not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for Eunuchs, ſo was not this Sacrament for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or fools. But Moral capacities are required by the Moral Law; and if they be the Foundation, they are alſo part of the Bilding; They were neceſſary to All men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſo to Communicants, and therefor cannot make This the Leſs neceſſary to Any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There can be but a Relative, and therefor limited command of its reception]</hi> It muſt Relate to, and be Limited by, Thoſe Ends, Capacities, Condicions and Diſpoſitions; and ſince <hi>Relata</hi> muſt be Equal, therefor the Performance muſt neither Exceed, nor Fall ſhort, but Equal thoſe Limits, <hi>i. e.</hi> we muſt neither Oftner nor Seldomer, nor Otherwiſe do it, than <hi>In remembrance of Chriſt,</hi> with due Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all requiſite Condicions.</p>
               <p>But Thoſe Condicions, thogh they be Limits of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the Maner, do not limit our Obligation to the Performance, being themſelves comprehended in it, as antecedently neceſſary upon the Moral account, <hi>Les a man
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59001:70"/> examin himſelf,</hi> is no leſs a Command, than <hi>So let him eat.</hi> The Diſpoſition it ſelf is a part of the Duty; and the want of it is ſo far from a Diſpenſation, that it is it ſelf a ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to Them who do receve it, the Inſtitution is a perfect and indiſpenſible commandment for the manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> Whoever doth it, being not thereto antecedently obliged, doth thereby thruſt himſelf upon a very Great, but Needleſs Trouble and Danger. For he was under no Obligation, till he put himſelf under one, by undertaking an action very Difficult to be do'n Worthily, and very Dangerous if do'n Unworthily; and that, without any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, derived from this Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>This is the whole that the moſt Excellent perſon and Only Patron could make of this ungrounded ſens of thoſe Relative words: And as I ſaid before of the whole queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we need no other than a due underſtanding of this One diſcourſ of the Apoſt'l, becauſe we have no other Scholiaſt upon our Lords Inſtitution; ſo ſay of This mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the queſtion. We need look no further for a due diſcovery of this ungrounded Interpretation, than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of this moſt Excellent Perſon: ſince among the multitudes that have be'n ſeduced by it, no other hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temted to put a regular countenance upon it: and This in effect doth but warn every conſidering perſon to ſo bear the performance, <hi>i. e.</hi> to deſtroy the Suppoſition he bilds upon.</p>
               <p>And if this be the Beſt, that its Beſt patron can make of it; what is the Worſt? we find the words twice, and in either place moſt ſtudioſly mentioned; In recital of our Lords Inſtitution they are carefully inſerted and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed; In the Argument thereupon bilt, they are ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſly reſumed, and ſetled as the Foundation; let us ſee what work they make in either place.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59001:71"/>IV. THIS interpretation enervates our LORD'S COMMAND. This we find abundantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. It is Only from Theſe words, Thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that we com now from hearing a Rare perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade it from a Command to an Inſtitution; ſuch a poor Inſtitution, as may complain with its great Author, <hi>it hath not a place where to lay it's head;</hi> It doth not Command our obedience, but Beg our benevolence, and begs alſo (with <hi>David</hi>'s curſe) <hi>in deſolate places;</hi> and which is yet worſ, in places laid deſolat by it ſelf, for it ſelf forbids us to give it the entertainment it begs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It enervats our Lords command,</hi> becauſe it cancelleth our obligations. By doing nothing we ſhall be as obedient, as by our moſt active diligence.</p>
               <p>For if the Command (let us for once beg That title) be purely Relative; If it do not Abſolutely enjoyn the Performance it ſelf, but only a Commenſuration between It and the Maner; than is it no more obeyed when Both are equally Performed, than when Both are equally Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected: He that never doth this at all, doth it no oftner than he doth it <hi>in remembrance of Christ;</hi> and therefor <hi>as often as he doth it he doth it to That end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commenſuration is no leſs exact when Both have the Moſt, and when Both have the Leaſt; yea, when Both have Nothing at all. And well may that be denyed the title of a Command, which is Performed by Neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But what title will be due to it's great Author? If he that doth Nothing may Obey, he muſt do ſomthing Leſs than nothing that Commands, becauſe he pretends to do ſomthing; and all the guilt of the neglect (if any be) will paſs from the obediently negligent Subject, to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently buſie Law-maker: who having not Required, but Suppoſed the Action, neither Found nor Made any ground for the Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>It <hi>forbids the benevolence it begs.</hi> For thogh it threaten
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59001:71"/> No guilt of diſobedience to the Omiſſion, it doth to the Performance. While we may ly ſafe in our Neglect, we run a great risk in our Officioſneſs.</p>
               <p>For he that Omitteth the Performance, diſobeyeth no command, therefor cannot incur any guilt, nor deſerv any puniſhment; but he that upon ſuch terms approacheth the Holy Table, is already gilty of contemt towards the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounced againſt Unworthy recevers, bicauſe he needleſly expoſeth himſelf to them, and to com ſafely off, had need of more Piety in the Performance, than we can Yet diſcover of Wiſdom in the adventure.</p>
               <p n="5">V. IF WE can ſuppoſe the Apoſt'l ſo regardleſs of our Saviors command: yet ſure he had more kindneſs for his OWN ARGUMENT, than to uſe ſuch ſolicitos endeavors to deſtroy it; and for his own Credit, than to furniſh the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with a Plea, whereby they might non-ſuit his Charge: He was (ſure) a better Diſciple both to <hi>Gamaliel</hi> and our Lord, than to uſe ſuch endeavors as, by the ordinary rules of reaſoning, muſt depoſe both his own Diſcourſ, and our Lords Command from all power.</p>
               <p>But ſuch is the unavoidable conſequence of the merely Suppoſitive ſens of thoſe important words. For it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Might; and therefor ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, that they Would plead thus for themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are ſufficiently ſenſible, that as often as we eat This bread and drink This cup, we ſhew forth the Lords death; and conſequently, that whoever eateth This bread and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this cup unworthily, is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. But in theſe our ordinary Feſts, which thou ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reproveſt, we have nothing to do with This bread nor This cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We Feſt indeed as often as we meet in the Church: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Intent, and (we conceve) without any Need, to eat This bread or drink This cup. We intend to do what all Nations agree to be the proper manner of worſhipping God. This is the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59001:72"/> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal notion of mankind, in that ſo common Rite of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing. The Votary therefor offereth his beaſt, that he may become a gueſt to his God, thereby at once Receiving and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing a confidence that he is propitious to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thogh our Lords great Sacrifice of himſelf, have made it needleſs to ſhed any more blood by way of atonement; yet is that ſo far from any reaſon, that we ſhould lay aſide Feſting with Sacrificing; that it is a very good one, why we ſhould take it up, if it had never be'n uſed before; ſince now we have much greater reaſon to rejoice in the Communion, to which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that in all our Feſts we ſhould be obliged to celebrate the Lords Supper, ſince himſelf hath not expreſſed it, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For either he intended we ſhould receive it only at the ſame Feſt, whereat he Inſtituted it (which was the Paſsover) or els he left it wholely to our diſcretion, to receve it as often as we ſhould think convenient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now that we intend not to do it in our ordinary meetings, thy ſelf ſeemeſt to underſtand. For thou declareſt,</hi> when ye come together it is not to eat the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it not, we own it, we plead it; It is not to eat the Supper, and how do we Profane it when we do not eat it? When we do Eat it, if our behavior be irreverent, we muſt confeſs our ſelves guilty: for we ſubmit to thy rule,</hi> As often as we Eat This bread and Drink this cup unworthily, <hi>we are guilty; but it thence followeth not, that we are ſo as often as we Feſt together in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is hard to ſay whether ſuch a plea were more obvios to the Apoſtl's Obſervation, or Deſtructive to his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was therefor infinitely neceſſary he ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, and we find no other Anſwer to it but in theſe words, nor any other Uſe of Thoſe words but for ſuch an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to perſwade us, ſo to interpret them, that the Argument be not Defective, nor Themſelves Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59001:72"/> But to faſten ſuch a Gloſs upon them, as ſhall make them not only Uſeleſs, but Pernicios; and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, not only naked of ſo neceſſary a defence, but ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably retorted againſt the Author, is perhaps a greater abuſe to Them, than the <hi>Corinthians</hi> profaneneſs was to the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. FOR a cloſe of this troubleſom diſpute, let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially ballance the rival ſenſes upon This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, which of all others is moſt important; <hi>viz. which of them affordeth better ſatisfaction to a pious ſoul,</hi> conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly enquiting how often he is obliged to receve the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion?</hi> A queſtion, wherein there are many things doubtful, but none more than This: Whether it more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or Need to be anſwered?</p>
               <p n="1">1, The One ſens offereth full ſatisfaction, by ſhewing us a Certain Meſure to which we muſt conform: And though the change long ſince made in the Manner of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating Church Feſtivals, ſeem to have confounded it, yet if we once know what it was at the time of the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may and muſt ſo accommodate the never decaying Reaſon to the Change, as ſtill to anſwer the firſt Intention: For if the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were therefor obliged to <hi>Eat the Lords Supper</hi> in All their Church meetings, bicauſe they Feſted in them All in One manner; ſo are we, bicauſe we alſo Feſt in them All in Another manner: Since the Manner of Publik worſhip, the Church upon competent reaſons may alter: but the Inſtitution of our Lord indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſibly cloſing All Church Feſts with his own Supper, No human power may aboliſh; at leaſt not in point of the Obligation, though poſſibly invincible neceſſity may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with Actual performance at ſom times.</p>
               <p>So by This account, the clear anſwer will be, That the Church muſt offer the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> as often as ſhe can perſuade the peopl to receve it; and every perſon is ſo often obliged to receve it, as the Church Officers ſhall offer it;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59001:73"/> and Both the Church, and every perſon oght to come as neer as poſſible, to doing it every Lords day and every Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, <hi>i. e.</hi> All days of Church Feſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the other Sens for want of a Standard, will pack us off with an anſwer more Deluſory than the Collier's. If we ask <hi>[How often muſt I do this in remembrance of Chriſt?]</hi> it will anſwer <hi>[As often as you eat This bread and drink This cup]</hi> If we then ask, <hi>[How often must I eat This bread and drink This cup]</hi> it will anſwer <hi>[As often as you do it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt.]</hi> This I ſay is more deluſory than the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Bicauſe it was poſſible to know what the Church believed. Publik Confeſſions, Canons of Councils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All of them independent upon the Collier or his Faith, and all know'n to the Catechiſt. But Here, we have No Declaration or Canon which pretends to oblige, 'till our own voluntary Act do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Collier was not the ſame perſon with the Church: He might poſſibly differ from her; or if he did Not, then might a further queſtion join them Both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by asking <hi>[How do both thou and the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve]</hi> call him to a determinate account of his Own and the Churches Faith.</p>
               <p>But here <hi>[This bread and This cup]</hi> are ſuppoſed to be a mere Periphraſe of the <hi>[Lords Supper]</hi> differing only in Syllables, and not at all in Signification.</p>
               <p>It is therefor impoſſible that ony one can Do This, which he would never have do'n had not our Lord commanded it, and not remember That Command which muſt be the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate reaſon of the Action; and it is no leſs impoſſible to remember the Command, without remembring the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Theſe are ſo far from ſeparable by any Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they cannot be made ſo by any Endeavor. And therefor it muſt be extremely frivolos, if the Apoſt'l ſhould ſo ſolemnly preſs this as reveled by our Savior, That [as often as we eat his Supper, we muſt eat his Supper.]</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59001:73"/>
               <p>Again, the entire queſtion is compounded of Both terms: For we ask not ſeparately <hi>[How often muſt we Do This?]</hi> as a diſtinct queſtion from <hi>[How often muſt we ſet forth our Lord's death?]</hi> But join Both in This queſtion <hi>[How often muſt we ſo do This, as thereby to ſet forth our Lord's death?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the Collier be'n thus Cateciſed, he could not have eſcaped either confeſſing his ignorance, or giving account of his belief. But here the clearer the Queſtion, the more unſatisfying the Anſwer: When different expreſſions are made different things, they may pretend to meſure each other; but when they are joined together as parts of one whole Suppoſitive duty, then we have no meſure at all:</p>
               <p>Yea, Thoſe very words which pretend to give us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act one, rob us of one that with ſom Latitude might have ſerved the turn. For without them, we could not have doubted, as now we do, whether we are under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an abſolute Command or no, as well to the Thing as to the Manner; nor be'n put to ſuch hard, yet unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous ſhifts, to make our Lords Inſtitution and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtl's Diſcourſe worthy their Authors.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAVEING thus ballanced the two pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and found the One not only Serviceable but Neceſſary, and the Other not only Unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, but Prejudicial both to our Lords Inſtitution and the Apoſtl's Argument, I might with corage proceed on in the remains of my journy.</p>
               <p>But ſenſibl how many prejudices he muſt encounter, who ſhall in ſo awful a ſubject oppoſe the ſtream, and unable to prophecy what might riſe in Other mens minds, I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated what I have above written to two or three pious and learned Friends, requeſting them to favor me with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59001:74"/> their Cenſures and Objections, that I might either anſwer them or ſubmit to them. Two Objections I have by that means obtained, which I think requiſite to Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THE FIRST OBJECTION ſaith, that <hi>The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom referred to is in many particulars novel, and by which we cannot judge of the practice of the Jews in our Saviors days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtrikes at the very heart, and muſt be carefully warded: I ſhall therefor firſt examin what is to be found of the Jews Opinions in the caſe, and then conſider what judgment is thereupon to be made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Jews think the Practice ſo far from novel, that they think it as ancient as (it's occaſion) the disbanding of the Camp in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s days, and the conſequent impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the whole Nations bringing their daily offering to the publik place of Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>This we have found in Dr. <hi>Caſtel</hi> upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> where he intimateth, that the people muſt tary for <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. becauſe he was the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And this ſeemeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Targum, which is elder than our Lords Inſtitution, and paraphraſeth the word which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Bleſſing, by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (whence perhaps our Latin <hi>Pars</hi>) which ſignifieth Breaking.</p>
               <p>But my learned Objector doth not impute novelty to the whole, but many particulars, and adviſeth me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the <hi>Miſna</hi> in <hi>Berachoth:</hi> I have do'n ſo, and thereby find reaſon enogh to ſuſpect the Jews care or felicity in preſerving their Antiquities, but not enogh to ſuſpect mine own Hypotheſis.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59001:75"/> ſitting at Supper, among whom one as the father of the family, or ſom venerable Rabbi, if ſuch be preſent as a gueſt, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pray and bleſs the Table with an audible voice, as is ſaid,</hi> Pſal. 34.4. <hi>Magnificate Dominum meum.</hi> Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>there are Two at leaſt;</hi> Mecum, <hi>there is the Third: if there be only Two, ether of them prayeth privately by himſelf.</hi> Here, and in moſt other of their Writeings, they ſpeak indifferently of the whole, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But if we com more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to enquire, what intereſt the Wine hath above the Bread, we ſhall find nothing certain, but what <hi>Shulch: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruch</hi> tells us, <hi>That they are divided into three Opinions.</hi> 1. <hi>Some ſay the Wine is ſo neceſſary to conſecrate a meal, that thogh a man eat ſingle, if he can get no Wine, he muſt rather faſt than eat without it; indeed he is not obliged to faſt more than one day.</hi> 2. <hi>A ſecond opinion is, That the Cup of Bleſſing is not at all neceſſary, be the number of guests never ſo many.</hi> 3. <hi>A third ſort ſay with our</hi> Leo Modena, <hi>that it muſt not be omitted if there be three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this laſt Opinion ſeemeth fairly intimated in the <hi>Berachoth</hi> it ſelf, if well interpreted. For in the eighth Chapter, reckoning up the differences between the houſes of <hi>Shammai</hi> and <hi>Hillel,</hi> they thus expreſs the laſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Which words may be thus tranſlated; <hi>There cometh to them Wine for the</hi> Poſcaenium, <hi>and there is there no other but That very Cup; The houſe of</hi> Shammai <hi>ſay, he bleſſeth firſt for the Wine, and afterward he bleſſeth for the Meat: But the houſe of</hi> Hillel <hi>ſay, he bleſſeth for the Meat, and afterward he bleſſeth for the Wine.</hi> In which words is plain, that all agree that there is Wine, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as we obſerved them to ſtile that After Supper.) 2. That there is but one cup for the whole company: and 3. That the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> bleſſeth for them All.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Zohar</hi> in <hi>Exod. p.</hi> 280. ſpeaketh full to our purpoſe, and nameth the Cup by his proper name, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing was not uſed unleſs when there were Three, becauſe of the myſtery of the Three fathers which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59001:75"/> bleſſed, and ſo there is no need of the Cup unleſs there be Three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon is moſt Rabbinical, <hi>i. e.</hi> moſt ridiculous, but the Authority is reputed great, becauſe moſt ancient, and the words are moſt pertinent and concluſive to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, plainly expreſſing how much they ſtood upon the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing,</hi> and what number it required.</p>
               <p n="2">II. UPON This account of mater of Fact, it will not be hard to paſs judgement, which I ſhall come to by ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WHETHER in our Saviors days they put ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Bread and Cup, is not neceſſary for us to determin; for the Apoſtl's Argument will go as ſtrongly (thogh perhaps not altogether as gracefully) without it, ſince his partiality to the Cup may otherwiſe be fairly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe we have ſeen from other pens that the Greeks underſtood the uſe of the Grace-cup, but we meet no ſuch foot-ſteps of their Breaking of bread; and it was reaſon the Apoſtl ſhould rather bild his inferences upon a cuſtom which they knew, than upon One which they knew not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Bread was never diſtributed After any Other Supper but only the Paſchal, and was Then attended with a form of words ſounding much like that which our Lord uſed in his Inſtitution: Since hence appeared ſom danger, leſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould miſtake our Lords meaning, it was fit the Apoſtl ſhould clear it; which he doth almoſt as plainly as if he had ſaid, <hi>You know the cuſtom of cloſeing a Feſt with a Cup of bleſſing, and you may know the cuſtom of the Jews diſtributing a Cake after the Paſsover; and probably you may think our Lord intended that his Supper ſhould be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, not by the Cup which was uſed after All Feſts, but by the Bread which was ſo uſed only after the Paſsover. But I tell
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59001:76"/> you, I have receved from the Lord himſelf, that you muſt celebrate his Supper as often as you drink the Grace cup.</hi> Here is ground enogh for his Argument and all its turnings, and we may ſafely ſpare the trouble either of enquiring or contending for the equal or unequal frequency of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bread.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WERE the Jewiſh <hi>Miſna</hi> or <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us in ſom material particulars, it were more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reject their Authority, than ſo Neceſſary and ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a Key. That we may ſee the reaſonableneſs of This aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, it will be fit to ballance them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Jewiſh Doctrines in maters of their deareſt Law be apparently changed from what they were in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors days, we oght to ſuſpect their care not to have be'n greater towards a Tradition: Let us then compare what our Lord ſaid, with what their <hi>Talmud</hi> now ſaith. The Goſpel informeth us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.5. that our Lord <hi>ſpake to the Phariſees and Lawyers, ſaying, Which of you ſhall have an Ox or an Aſs falen into a pit, and will not ſtraightway pull him out on the Sabbath day? And they could not anſwer him to theſe things:</hi> Which yet they might have do'n, if their then Doctrines had be'n agreeable to thoſe of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which forbiddeth to pull him out, but alloweth to carry meat to feed him; and if need be, ſtraw to ſupport him in the place.</p>
               <p>And accordingly <hi>Munſter</hi> furniſheth us with a pertinent ſtory out of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals. A Jew (ſaith he) fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Jakes on the Sabbath, would not be draw'n out, but have meat brought him thither, which the Biſhop hearing of, required that the ſame honor ſhould be paid to the Chriſtian Sabbath; ſo the poor Jew ſuffered two days pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the <hi>Talmud's</hi> ſwerving from ancient practice.</p>
               <p>I pretend not to equal any evidence with the Goſpel: It is ſufficient that I hence infer, that we may not argu from their Preſent cuſtoms to their Ancient, ſo as to reject
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59001:76"/> any probable light, eſpecially when ſo confirmed as we are by ſom of their own Rabbies.</p>
               <p n="3">III. 3. SEEING ſo great a party of them ſo ſtate their Tradition, as moſt exactly jointeth with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtl's diſcourſ, we have great reaſon to believe Them to be in the right.</p>
               <p>This, not as an arbitrator between the diſſenting Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, but in defence of my Hypotheſis from my worthy Friends Objection, I thus confirm from the exact agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I found between the Apoſtl's Argument and That Cuſtom ſo ſtated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Argument muſt proceed from Chance, from the Jews accommodating their Cuſtom to our Lords Inſtitution; or from our Lords accommodating his Inſtitution to the Jewiſh Cuſtom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was not from either of the Former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefor it was from the Laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Diviſion is adaequate needeth no proof: For Ether it muſt be by Chance, or it muſt Not, (ſince there can be no midl between the two ends of a Contradiction) If it were Not by chance, then ether That Cuſtom muſt conform to This Inſtitution, or This to That: (For they cannot meet unleſs <hi>Mahomet</hi> go to the Mountain, or the Mountain com to <hi>Mahomet.</hi>)</p>
               <p>The Aſſumtion I thus prove by parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It cannot proceed from Chance:</hi> Such a concurſ, of ſo many and ſo crooked particls, can be no more imputed to undiſcerning chance, than can the meeting of the letters in the diſcurſ it ſelf. Chance may do one thing well, as a blind man may ſhoot a Hare, but he cannot ſhoot multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes without miſſing one.</p>
               <p>When a FINE is levied in Court, the Chirographer wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth two Copies at a competent diſtance in the ſame Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In the ſpace between them he writes two or three letters; then he cutteth the Parchment in the middle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denturewiſe, ſo as to divide thoſe Letters, leaving either
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59001:77"/> indenture ſom part, that upon any occaſion the conterparts compared together, may by ſo many agreements vouch ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the other.</p>
               <p>There happened a queſtion between three parties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conditions of a Fine levied time out of mind: Two of the contenders produce for proof of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences common Parchments, atteſted only by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: The third produceth an Indenture of Fine, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him by his Father, with its counterpart, which (by I know not what means) he had obtained out of the Scriptoire of another Family: He applieth the One to the Other, ſheweth their exact agreement in every word of the Writing, every turning of the Indenture, and every ſtroke of the divided Letters; and proveth this could not be the effect of any colluſion, bicauſe there had ever be'n, and ſtill continued, a mortal feud between his own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and That whence he had gotten the counterpart.</p>
               <p>If this be our preſent Caſe, we are to conſider 2 things: Firſt, the agreement of the Counterparts; and 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, the impoſſibility of Colluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Agreement of the Apoſtl's Argument with the Thus ſtated Cuſtom, we have fully diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Body of the diſcourſ in either Chapter. In the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>chap.</hi> both Bread and Cup caled by their proper Jewiſh names, and under Thoſe very names urged to be Body and Blood of the Lord. In the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>chap.</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument no other way, Rational; This way, Unanſwerable; many words and Aſpects of words, no other way account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; This way, Neceſſary: the Charge otherwiſe to be evaded; This way, Unavoidable: In the whole, not one word, or order of words, impertinent, deficient, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluos.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Indenting, every reeling ſtep, exactly jointed with the anſwerably crooked proceſs of the Argument. No diſcourſ in the World ſo full of odd bizarreries; every one this way rendered, rational, clear, and convictive.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59001:77"/>
               <p>In the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>chap.</hi> the names of Both elements induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſly ſo Varied, as to anſwer the Jewiſh ſtile; and ſo Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, as to anſwer the Apoſtl's argument. In the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>chap.</hi> the Demonſtrative <hi>THIS</hi> affectedly inculcated, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> inforcedly appropriate to the Cup, thogh diſtributed in like manner with the Bread. The Bread honored above the Cup one way, &amp; the Cup above the Bread another way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Letters ſo cut in ſunder, that in the Apoſtl's diſcourſ we find but one half, not to be read but by ſupplying the other half from the Tradition. <hi>THIS</hi> without an object, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> without a relative, look like tails of Letters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heads; but by application to This cuſtom, becom fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legible.</p>
               <p>So exact agreement in ſuch ſtrange variety: one would think Gods providence here acted the Chirographer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Apoſtl's pen in ſuch a manner, that after the death of all Wirneſſes, and loſs or embeazling of all other Evidences, we might by this multiplied ſutableneſs, be armed againſt all doubt, which either malice or careleſneſs of the Jews, forgetting or corrupting their Tradition, might bring upon us.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 2. THE other part of my Aſſumtion is, that <hi>This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement could not be the iſſu of the Jews conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their practice to our Lords Inſtitution:</hi> Since the greateſt Care maried to the greateſt Wit, Could not produce ſuch an offspring, and the Jews Would not employ ether the One or the Other to ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It were extravagant credulity to believ they Would employ ſuch Care. Their very differences concerning the Tradition of their Fathers, is abundant evidence that they minded not its agreement or diſagreement with our Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: And their known zele againſt our Lord and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, is a yet greater one, that they would not be more careful to explain the Ones inſtitution and the Others argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than all the Fathers of the Chriſtian Church have be'n.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59001:78"/>
               <p>Shall we believ their eſteem for their <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> ſo much greater than their hatred of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that they ſhould he more than maſorically careful to contrive a way whereby to make ſuch a diſcourſ worthy the Diſciple of their ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Maſter? Do they ſo glory in their anceſtors crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord of Life, that they put themſelves to great care and coſt to adorn the Monument which himſelf raiſed to his own memory, and That with ſuch Figures as ſhould blazon His great goodneſs and their great wickedneſs? Were the Jewiſh Rabbins ſo much more careful of Chriſts worſhip than the Fathers of his own Church; that when Theſe had loſt the key which muſt unlock his Oracles, Thoſe took the pains to make a new one?</p>
               <p>Whoever can believ this, ſhall never from Them receve the thanks which he ſhall deſerv for ſuch exorbitant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To believ their Wit capable of finding out ſuch an invention, is no leſs incredible. So many wheels, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motions, ſo ſmoothly and ſo ſtrongly cooperating: ſo remote from the common practice of All other Nations; ſo ſuitable to the humor of their own, ſo exactly fitting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very titl of the Apoſtl's diſcourſe, and the circumſtances wherein it was written, was ſure above all human Wit to invent. Many diſcoveries appear obvious when made, which yet for thouſands of years eſcaped the ſagacity of all mankind: The very difficulties and odneſſes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles diſcurſ have be'n ſo far from Smoothed, that many of them have not be'n Obſerved by any Critiks and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators; and perhaps might not have be'n ſo now, had not their agreement with This key occaſioned it.</p>
               <p>It is not to be believed that the Apoſtl ſhould make the leaſt fals ſtep, drop the leaſt ſyllable that ſhould be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, much leſs that ſhould be miſchievos to his deſign: And the account that is to be given of them, muſt equal the ſum to a farthing: Whoever will ſuppoſe the Diſcourſ worthy of a reaſonabl man, much more whoever will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59001:78"/> it worthy the Holy Spirit; if he reject what I offer, Let him to his ſtudy, let him ſummon together All his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, let him uſe as much liberty of invention as he pleaſe; and if he can find out any Hypotheſis that ſhall ſo cleverly anſwer all the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>—erit mihi magnus Apollo.</q>
               <p>Since therefor chance Could not, and the Jews neither could nor would conform their practice to our Lords Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and the Apoſtl's diſcurſe: The concluſion muſt be, That both This and That were conformed to the Jewiſh practice: And I thank my worthy Friend for giving me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to confirm what I have ſaid by this Reflection.</p>
               <p n="5">V. ANOTHER OBJECTION ſaith, That if our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency in celebrating the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> muſt be meſured by ſuch a Grace-cup; ſince there can be no ſuch Grace-cup where there is no Feſt (no more than there can be an end without a beginning, or an Adjunct without a Subject) it will be as neceſſary that a Feſt ſhould alway uſher the Lords Supper, as that the Lords Supper ſhould attend every Feſt: and ſo the reverſ of our Hypotheſis, will no leſs ſeverely reprove the Univerſal Church of Chriſt, for Not feſting in All meetings, than did the Apoſtl the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for not honoring the Lords Supper in them All: but every particular member of Chriſt's Church will be blameleſs, though he never communicate in ſuch manner as by his Church-officers he is invited to do; ſince he is to do it only <hi>ſo often</hi> as by That Practice whence Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was derived, he is obliged, <hi>i. e.</hi> only ſo often as a Feſt is to be cloſed with a cup of bleſſing.</p>
               <p>To anſwer ſuch an Objection, and withal to juſtifie our Anceſtors, for caſting ſenſual Feſts out of the Church, I ſhall ſay ſufficient, <hi>Part III. Chap.</hi> 3. Beſides theſe two Objections, for which I am obliged to my Friends, two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offered themſelves to mine own mind, which I alſo think fit to anſwer.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59001:79"/>VI. IT may be further objected, That the Jewiſh Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom concerned not Religious Worſhip, but Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtik Feſts, as worthy of greater reverence, ſaying, <hi>What? Have ye not houſes to eat and to drink in, or deſpiſe ye the Church of God?</hi> Since therefor the Grace-cup was to be drunk in their Own houſes, and This in the Church, how can the One be derived from the Other?</p>
               <p>I anſwer This Objection by ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not requiſite, that the Succeſſor ſhould anſwer the Predeceſſor in all Circumſtances: Yea, the One may be oppoſed to the Other in very material Ones. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, even when he pleadeth Chriſt to be the tru Sacrifice, oppoſeth his blood to that of <hi>bulls and goats,</hi> as in other reſpects, ſo in This of Frequency: Thoſe were offered often, This but Once; yet were Thoſe types of This.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is requiſite, that rhe Succeſſor ſhould be more perfect than the Predeceſſor; The Antitype muſt excel the Type, as the Goſpel doth the Law; the Body the Shadow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Difference of place (the ground of the Objection) is cauſed by difference of Diſpenſations: That Gods worſhip is no longer confined to One Place, is one of the great changes wrought by the Goſpel; and This makes it needleſs for Us to make out own houſes Temples: Gods Houſe is ſo near our own, that we need no Chappels of eaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This was the very deſign of the Tradition, they took the Names, and did what poſſibly they could to perform the Things; caled their Table an Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to do their utmoſt, and com as near as poſſibly they could, to the performance which could not legally be accompliſhed but only at <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefor is ſo far from an Objection againſt our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving the Lords Supper from ſuch a Tradition, that it is a Reaſon for it. It doth not in This reſpect contradict it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59001:79"/> (as at firſt glance it may ſeem to do) but comply with it: The Tradition expreſſed their endeavor to offer their meat in God's houſe, if poſſibly they could; and ſince that which they ſo profeſſed to endeavor, is to us not only Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but Eaſy, we could not anſwer the very fundamental deſign of the Tradition, if we did not make the Lord's Houſe the place of his Supper.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This difference of Place, ſpeaks the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> ſucceſſor, not only to the Tradition (which was it ſelf but a <hi>Succedaneum</hi>) but to the Legal Sacrifices themſelvs: That hindrance being removed which induced the Jews to invent ſuch a ſupply, This Inſtitution by a motion of refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liency, paſſeth through rhe <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to the Principal: Yea, and the very Principal it anſwers, not as an Inferior, but a Superior; and therefor required a Place Superior (if poſſibl) not only to their own houſes, but the Templ it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtl maketh This an Inſtance of the greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of Chriſt's Prieſt-hood, that he entered into a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier place than did <hi>Aaron</hi> or his ſeed: Since therefor this Bread and Wine hath a better title to Chriſts Body and Blood, than had the fleſh and blood of Bulls and Goats, and yet Thoſe might not legally be offered but at God's Houſe; and ſince This very Tradition profeſſed to do what poſſibly could be do'n, to Feſt before God in his own Houſe; it was not ſuitable either to the greater dignity of this Holier Sacrifice, or to the very ſignificancy of the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſhould be celebrated (except in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) in any other than God's own Houſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As the dignity of the Sacrament, ſo the intereſt of the Poor too (Chriſt's body in another ſens) caled for This tranſlation.</p>
               <p>The Rich make as many Feſts as Meals, and were their own Tables the Altars, might celebrate daily Sacraments: But the Poor (to whom our Lord bears as great affection as to his Supper) ſeldom eat Three together (which is the neceſſary Number) or drink Wine (which is the Neceſſary
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59001:80"/> Mater) and for this dubl defect muſt be excommunicate, thogh guilty of no other falt, but (what they certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent) their Poverty.</p>
               <p>What therefor they muſt otherwiſe have loſt, they gain by the publikneſs of the Place, which alſo gains the greater number: So the Poor gain the Feſt, and the Table gains Gueſts, and the Tradition gaineth greater perfection, by being So anſwered as to be outdo'n by the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. THE moſt Obvios OBJECTION (or Prejudice rather, which hath more force thogh leſs weight than an Objection) cometh from the Univerſal ſilence of All ages, in a Subject of ſuch importance. For it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth utterly incredibl, that in ſo many hundreds of years, and thouſands of Books, we ſhould not meet one word that ſo much as intimateth what might juſtly require to be moſt plainly Manifeſted.</p>
               <p>But This Objection, however big it looks at firſt ſight, Will hardly ſtand a ſtrict examination, or reply upon what ſhall be anſwered.</p>
               <p>For ('pray' Reader) conſider, Whence will you expect ſuch an account? From the Primitive ages? They thoght it needleſs: From the Later? They thoght it Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The PRIMITIVE ages thoght it Needleſs to give ſuch an account in their Writings, bicauſe they conſtantly gave it in their Practice. It would have be'n a diſparagement to the Inſtitution to have writen upon it, as the bungling Painter did upon his rude pieces, <hi>This is a Cock, This is a Bull,</hi> &amp;c. and it would have be'n a fulſom officioſneſs to inform a Reader of what he daily ſaw with his eyes.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of every Negative ceremonial Law, was at the time of ſtabliſhment legibl as the Letter: but in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Generations almoſt utterly loſt, till <hi>Maimonides</hi> diſcovered, that moſt of them pointed at ſom Idolatrous Ceremony, at That time practiſed by the neighbor Nations,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59001:80"/> and therefor forbidden the Jews, upon the ſame account as were their daghters.</p>
               <p>And the ſame is the caſe in moſt Poſitive commands: Generally ſom preſent cuſtom declares the contents, thogh afterward by degrees, it wears into more and more obſcurity, and in proceſs of time grows utterly ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
               <p>I inſtance only in the Other Sacrament. Both Scripture and Antiquity have be'n altogether as ſilent concerning the Origination of That, as of This. All that we read of it in the Goſpel amounts to no more but This, that <hi>John</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred it, the People received it, and the Phariſees que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, <hi>Why Baptiſeſt thou, if thou be not the Chriſt, nor</hi> Elias, <hi>nether that Prophet?</hi> No Evangeliſt thought fit to expound the reaſon either of the Action or Objection, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Then knowen cuſtom ſufficiently manifeſted it; which yet was loſt as much as This, to many Generations, thogh now retrived and generally owned by the Learned: and why ſhould not This ſhare the right of <hi>Poſtliminium,</hi> as it hath do'n the loſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. LATER ages deſired to hide any ſuch notice. They bent their endeavors to advance the honor of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the higheſt pitch of veneration, and might well ſuſpect, leſt ſuch a diſcovery ſhould depreſs its eſteem. They ſaw how ſhort the Greek Feſts fell, not only of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Piety, but Ordinary Sobriety, and thought ſo baſe a deſcent, too great a diſparagement to ſo venerable a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which they therefor thoght might loſe much of its honor, if its pedigree were not caſt into the den of time to be there devoured.</p>
               <p>And who can ſecure us, that upon This very reaſon we may not have loſt ſom of the Primitive Writers informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in This particular? We know the labors of Earlier ages lay at the mercy of the Later, to be ether preſerved or ſuppreſſed, as they ſhould judge moſt ſuitable to their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59001:81"/> own conceptions, we know how induſtrious they have be'n to ſtrain their inventions, for dignifying the Sacrament with ſuch myſteries as may dazel our underſtandings; and it is hard to imagin they ſhould be very careful to preſerve any ſuch Papers as muſt bring light to confute their deareſt Opinions.</p>
               <p>Yet hath the Laſt inquiſitive Age, in victory over the dubl hindrance, Expreſly diſcovered the One, and Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Other half of the loſt Hypotheſis: <hi>Whether our Lord in his Inſtitution adopted ſom Jewiſh Tradition?</hi> is at leaſt half the queſtion: And this is affirmed by ſeveral of the moſt celebrated Critiks of this Century.</p>
               <p>Our admirable Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his excellent Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hath ſaid enough to juſtifie me from affectation of novelty, in That Half which relates to our Lords Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, thogh without any eye to the Apoſtl's Argument, and our Duty.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. He hath this Paraphraſe: <hi>And whileſt</hi> Judas <hi>was there, before any of them was riſen from the Table, Jeſus, in imitation of the Jews cuſtom after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (of diſtributing Bread and Wine about the Table, as an argument of charity—inſtituted the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as a conteſſeration of charity among all Chriſtians —telling them that this taking and eating, was now inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him as an holy rite,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. he thus Paraphraſeth: <hi>In like manner after they had do'n eating, he took the cup of charity, uſual among the Jews, and ſaid, This cup is at this time.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is true, in both theſe places, and in his note upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. He referreth the Inſtitution to the Paſchal Supper, which ſeemeth better to fit our Lords Inſtitution; but coming to the words I have ſo much inſiſted on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. he found himſelf neceſſitated to enlarge the meſure; for thus he Paraphraſeth thoſe words: <hi>And do ye [in all your ſacred Feſtivals] thus ſhow forth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The ſame ſaith <hi>Cameron</hi> on the ſame Text. The ſame and more hath <hi>Grotius,</hi> who further proveth, That the Greeks as well as the Jews cloſed their Feſts with a cup of Wine ſolenly conſecrated? And this Virtually diſcovereth the Other Half, which ſo naturally followeth, that it is ſtrange how One could be admitted without the Other.</p>
               <p>That the Primitive ages ſhould wholely omit any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lords regard to the Jewiſh Cuſtoms, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that it was ſufficiently evident, That the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages ſhould induſtrioſly hide it upon fear of prejudice to their admirable Myſteries, That the Laſt age ſhould retrive it in their ſearch of Antiquities: Nothing of all This is ſo wonderful, as it is, that thoſe who had the skill and happineſs to diſcover Theſe <hi>Indies,</hi> ſhould not care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves with ſuch Treaſures, as without digging offered themſelves, eſpecially the wind blowing ſo hard as almoſt to compel them to Land.</p>
               <p>For ſince we derive all our practical Doctrines concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing This duty from the Apoſtl's diſcourſe to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and That diſcourſe appealeth to This Inſtitution; it is manifeſt, we oght not to ſit down by any ſuch Cuſtoms, as can only anſwer That Inſtitution as abſtracted from This Argument, and not conſiſt with This Argument ſo built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on That inſtitution: Nor is it leſs manifeſt, that the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Cuſtoms, however large enogh for That, were too narrow for This.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> could not Paraphraſe the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſ,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extending it to <hi>All Festival meetings.</hi> If then there were two ſorts of Cuſtoms, Som only Annual, Others or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Feſtival; Thoſe, agreeing with our Lords Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but deſtroying our Apoſtl's Argument; and Theſe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59001:82"/> exactly agreeing with Both, it cannot be very diſputable, which of the two we are to receve for our ſtandard.</p>
               <p>Whatever weight therefor might have be'n in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, upon ſuppoſal of ſuch an Univerſal ſilence, the ſame muſt be in our Anſwer, or rather our Plea; For the authority of ſuch eminent perſons will bear me out in my fundamental Hypotheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Lords Inſtitution was derived from a Jewiſh Cuſtom: and plain Reaſon will bear me out in what I further add; <hi>viz.</hi> that it muſt be Such a Cuſtom as may agree not only with our Lords Text, but the Apoſtl's Gloſs too.</p>
               <p>So the wiſe maſter-bilders have laid the foundation, and I have taken ſuch <hi>care how I bild thereupon,</hi> that I hope my good Reader will find no cauſe to complain, otherwiſe than our Modern bilders do of ancient Houſes; that they are Stronger and Darker, with Thicker Walls and Leſs Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows than needed.</p>
               <p>To the Former part of ſuch an Objection I anſwer, that Thickneſs of Walls may be a falt in a dwelling Houſe, but not in a Caſtel, which muſt expect to be battered and ſtormed by the whole Country.</p>
               <p>To the Later part: That if I cannot be juſtified by the neceſſity which obliged me to diſpute in ſuch manner as the Subject mater required; yet I hope I ſhall be Pardoned, upon amendment in the remaining part of my Work, to which upon That hope I now apply my ſelf.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ITHERTO I have labored to ſerve the Learned and the Inquiſitive, the Able and the Willing, to ſearch both the ground of our Lords Inſtitution, and the Apoſtl's diſcourſe concerning it; which reciprocate ſuch light to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I hope every ſuch Reader is fully ſatisfied, both
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59001:83"/> in Conſcience and Curioſity. But there ar many other, who ether underſtand not ſuch work, or will not ſuffer the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue; whom I ſhall now endeavor to fit with leſs troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>It is much eaſier both to Underſtand and to Attend the the proceſs of an Hiſtory, than that of an Argument; and the ſens of Mater of Fact, as it is more Obvious, ſo is it generally more Potent than That of Mater of Right.</p>
               <p>What therefor I have hitherto be'n proving to have be'n our Lord's and Apoſtl's mind, concerning our obligation to conſtancy, I ſhall now authoriſe by the ſuitable Practice of All the Apoſtl's and Primitive Churches. In This Chapter I ſhall ſearch the Scripture for the Former; and in the following I ſhall look into humane Writers for the Later.</p>
               <p>In This Chapter let us vieu the Scripture, and ſee the ſtrange unhappineſs of This Subject! We might well hope to 'ſcape all diſputes concerning Mater of Fact: when the witneſs is infallibl, what can we need more but to hear him? Yes, we need underſtand him too; and as in the Apoſtl's argument we have found difficulty, bicauſe thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were familiar to His age, are worn out in Ours: So the ſame difficulty ſtill purſueth us in the very Hiſtory. We muſt not only vieu what is written, but we muſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Search and Examin, and that carefully too, what is meant when report is made even of Mater of Fact.</p>
               <p>But we have This comfort, that as the troubl will be now leſs, ſo will our diſcoveries be more various; and at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep we ſhall meet ſomthing worth the no great labor of the inquiry.</p>
               <p>Two things will be worth our obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How careful our Lord was to recommend his Inſtitution, and how backward the Apoſtls were in Apprehending his meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How diligent the Apoſtl's were in Obeying his will, when well informed concerning it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:59001:83"/>1. It is worth obſerving (be it but for our own juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that notwithſtanding our Lords care to inſtruct them, the Apoſtl's themſelves were as hardly broght to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his mind in his Inſtitution, as we ar now. And it is more particularly obſervable, that Thoſe endeavors which he uſed to recommend it to their affections, met the ſame ſucceſs, as we have ſeen follow thoſe very words of the Apoſtl, whereby he endeavored to prove the neceſſity of conſtancy.</p>
               <p>Our Lord's care to recommend it appeareth eſpecially by two Actions. 1. His timeing the Inſtitution: Secondly, His care to mind them of it, while freſh in memory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He choſe the fitteſt Time for the Inſtitution. The Apoſtl obſerved it, and we ſhall anon find another occaſion more fully to conſider how obſervable it is, that it was <hi>the Laſt night,</hi> and That <hi>wherein he was betrayed:</hi> and the Evangeliſt is careful to commemorate, with what affection he embraced That Paſsover, for This very reaſon, bicauſe it was the moſt proper for This Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>But That diſmal night, however ſeaſonable to endear it to Future times, was leaſt ſo, for it's publication to the Preſent. It was natural, that the dreadful Tragedy then impending, ſhould ſo confound both their Apprehenſions and Memories, as utterly to rob them of all other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but of their Lord's and their Own dangers, leaving them no power to regard the at-ſuch-a-time-ſcarce-conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable action.</p>
               <p>To cure This inconvenience, he applyeth a contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and that ſpeedily.</p>
               <p n="2">II. HIS Reſurrection was matter of as great Joy, as his Paſſion was of Grief or Fear, and he makes That an opportunity to remedy the Other.</p>
               <p>After his Death they met together, not to Feſt but Faſt, bicauſe the <hi>Bridegroom was taken from them:</hi> the news of his Reſurrection muſt give them the <hi>garments of gladneſs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59001:84"/> for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> and invite them both to turn their Faſting to Feſting, and to cloſe their Feſts with his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as he had both very Carefully and very Lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>He therefor contriveth a way whereby he may at once aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them of the truth of his Reſurrection, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Inſtitution. The ſtory we meet in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.13. which bicauſe we as litle heed now, as the Apoſtl's did then, will require ſom Animadverſion.</p>
               <p>Finding Two Diſciples traveling together, to complete the neceſſary number, himſelf makes a Third. He joins himſelf to them, diſcourſes with them, gives them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient opportunity and occaſion to obſerv his countenance, his voice, his meen, and whatever els he might be know'n by. But theſe (it ſeems) were Diſciples in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, not ſuch as ordinarily converſed with him; and they knew him not ſo perfectly, as to diſcover him in ſuch circumſtances.</p>
               <p>He ſuppeth with them, and having by his diſcourſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf a Rabbin, takes the office of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Breaker, and performs it not in the Accuſtomed, but his Own New form; points not ſo much to the Bread as to his own Body, and thereby ſo manifeſted his Perſon, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly they knew him.</p>
               <p>This gives us an Hypotheſis ſuitable to all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the ſtory, otherwiſe unaccountable; and if our eyes be withholden that we no more know his Meaning now, than the Diſciples did his Perſon by the way, let us look how we ſhall anſwer theſe queſtions.</p>
               <p>How came their eyes to be opened, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in or by [the] breaking of [the] Bread, more than by all his other appearances? You ſay, he might diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf When and How he pleaſed. True: but the queſtion concerneth not his Power, but his Will which governs that Power, and is it ſelf governed by his Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>We therefor further demand, Why he that Could do it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59001:84"/> in what circumſtances he pleaſed, ſhould Chuſe to do it in Theſe, rather than any Other? This ſay you, is a ſaucy queſtion; we are not to call our Lord to account for his actions.</p>
               <p>But may we not be bolder with his ſervants? his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Evangeliſt? Let us then inquire concerning them. Why were the Diſciples ſo careful to report This very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance? Why the Evangeliſt ſo punctual to record, that they reported not only the Thing, but the Manner, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>How (or in what manner) he was knowen to them by</hi> [the] <hi>breaking of</hi> [the] <hi>Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here meet an unaccountabl Will of our Lord chooſing This very Manner of diſcovering himſelf, the no leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountabl Care of the Diſciples reporting This Manner, and of the Evangeliſt recording both the One and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Muſt All this be imputed to a fortuit concurſ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deſign in ether of the Three, to honor the by Them Unregarded, and to Us Inſignificant Circumſtance?</p>
               <p>Once more. We muſt never fly to a Miracle, where we find Nature: nor muſt we ſuppoſe our Lord to have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his miraculous Power without his Wiſdom. We have a fair ſmooth account one way, his action ſuitable to his Own laſt Inſtitution, in circumſtances exact, his form of words <hi>[This is my Body]</hi> in the moſt proper manner ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Who he was, and Why he did this, muſt needs by natural ſignificance <hi>open their eyes;</hi> thoſe of their Bodies to diſcover his Perſon, and thoſe of their Underſtandings, to diſcover his Inſtitution. On the other ſide, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a needleſs, fruitleſs Miracle, which we cannot believ, without Neglecting our Lords wiſdom, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing our Own.</p>
               <p>Yet are the Apoſtl's eyes holden: This Seaſon upon a contrary diſorder blinding their apprehenſions, as the Paſſion-night had do'n. For thogh He appeared to them whiles This very action was in relating, diſcourſed with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59001:85"/> them, ſhewed them his hands and his feet, yet at firſt they believed not for Joy and Wondering. Which Paſſions, thogh they blew from a contrary point, broght violence enogh to ruffle their minds into ſuch confuſion, that they could not diſcover his very Perſon, much leſs his Mind.</p>
               <p>No leſs than forty days did their eyes continu thus hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, nor were they opened, 'till the miraculous illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit of Truth, broght all our Lords ſayings (with their explications) to mind.</p>
               <p>The ſame St. <hi>Luke</hi> which records theſe appearances, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Goſpel with this ſhort account of their Devotions: <hi>They were continually in the Temple praiſing and bleſſing God.</hi> And with the ſame character doth he deſcribe it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. <hi>They all continued with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in prayer and ſupplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jeſus, and with his brethren.</hi> Not a ſyllabl of <hi>[the breaking of the Bread]</hi> here or any where els, during the whole forty days.</p>
               <p>But immediatly upon the coming of <hi>That Spirit of Truth,</hi> which according to our Lords promiſe, <hi>led them into all Truth, and brought all things to their remembrance that ever he had ſaid unto them,</hi> and not only to their Remembrance, but to their Underſtanding; Then did they both Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Underſtand, All that our Lord ſaid, did, and meant, concerning his Supper.</p>
               <p n="3">III. AND now we are com'n to the ſecond Obſervable, viz: <hi>How diligent they were in performing this duty when they knew it.</hi> For immediatly we find This added to their other Devotions, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>They continued in the Apoſtl's doctrine and communion, and in [breaking of bread] and in prayer;</hi> and in verſ. 46. <hi>They continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe, did participate the food,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with gladneſs and freedom of heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59001:85"/>
               <p>And here, bicauſe it may poſſibly be queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Lords Supper be meant, we ought to obſerv. 1. <hi>The Exerciſes accompanying it.</hi> 2. <hi>The Phraſe expreſſing it.</hi> 3. <hi>The Place of celebration.</hi> 4. <hi>The Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The EXERGISES ACCOMPANYING it,</hi> were All Holy, <hi>Bleſsing God, Supplication, Prayer,</hi> All Acts of Devotion; What maketh <hi>Breaking of bread</hi> in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? What fellowſhip hath God with Epicurus?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The PHRASE</hi> is Diverbial, every one in That age underſtood it. <hi>Eating of Bread</hi> was their idiom for a Feſt; and <hi>Breaking of Bread,</hi> for the conſecration of it by this Ceremony: ſo that This was not only the moſt Proper, but the Only Phraſe that could have be'n uſed to expreſs both That Cuſtom and This Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Why St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould here give the Bread the honor to denominate, when we found St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo partial to the Cup; we need ſeek for no other reaſon, but This, <hi>viz.</hi> The Jews uſed ſo to ſpeak; yet is there another.</p>
               <p>Thoſe cavilers who had ſo ſtrained to impeach the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as <hi>drunk with new wine,</hi> would not have failed to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Meetings, as drunken compotations, if themſelvs ſhould have profeſſed they met <hi>to drink the Cup.</hi> In This ſtile therefor is wiſely conſulted the honor of the Exerciſe: which is hereby ſo far removed from any ſuſpicion of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, that is not ſo bad as ordinary Eating; ſo far from Riotous, that it could not be ſuſpected to be merely Civil.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 3. <hi>THe PLACE</hi> where this Exerciſe was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeemeth to oppoſe it's Sacredneſs, and therefor requireth more than ſuperficial heed. The word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Our received Tranſlation En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſheth it <hi>[from houſe to houſe]</hi> ſome Margins <hi>[at home]</hi> Ether of them importing a Common Place, would denote Common Bread: but let us conſider.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:59001:86"/>
               <p>The Apoſtl's, oppoſing the Religion legally eſtabliſhed, were neceſſitated to hold Conventicles, for fear of the Rulers, when they met to celebrate This office, which by Them was abominated, and would certainly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted.</p>
               <p>The Templ was a publik place for Jews and Gentiles, It was a <hi>houſe of Prayer for all nations,</hi> bicauſe Natural, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Religion taught all Nations to pray and praiſe God; Thus far might the Apoſtls communicate, as well with their Enemies as Diſciples; and that they might ſo do, they <hi>continued daily with one accord in the Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhould they have preſumed There to celebrate This Chriſtian office, and thereby to Upbraid their Rulers for having <hi>deſtroyed the Lord of life;</hi> they muſt infallibly have drawen upon themſelves, not only certain Diſturbance, but certain Deſtruction. It was therefor abſolutely neceſſary, to cary This office to ſom Other place, wherein they might eſcape both eyes and hands of enemies: And if there were Any to be found that emulated the Templ, as the Tradition did the Sacrifice; That, above All other, might beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the honor.</p>
               <p>Our induſtrious <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> have abundantly proved, that the Jews and their Proſelytes, in their greater houſes, were careful to provide a large upper room for Religious Exerciſes. Such was That, wherein our Lord inſtituted This Sacrament, Such (if not the ſame) was That, wherein <hi>the eleven continued with</hi> Mary, &amp;c. <hi>in prayer and ſupplication,</hi> to the number of 120. Such That, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> preached when <hi>Eutyches</hi> fell down from the third loft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59001:86"/> finding it ſo far from Safe, that it was not Poſſibl, to perform This office in the Temple, ſhould provide for their Quiet and Safety; and but Pious, that they ſhould chuſe ſuch a Place as might com as near the Templ as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl, both in Greatneſs and Holineſs.</p>
               <p>This <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we again find joined with the Templ, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. The Angel of the Lord commanded the Apoſtl's <hi>to preach to the people in the Templ,</hi> verſ. 20. And in the laſt verſe we find their obedience ſuch, that <hi>daily in the Templ, and [in every houſe]</hi> (if the Tranſlation ſpeak truth) <hi>they ceaſed not to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> But the Greek ſpeaketh as before. In conformity to the Angels command, <hi>they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the people in the Templ,</hi> that they might Convert the yet Unconverted; and they did the ſame and more in the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to confirm thoſe that were already Diſcipled.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have found fair Probabilities: Now I add a Demonſtration, not heeded by the above-named Learned Authors. Hitherto we have found it in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but upon cogent reaſon we ſhall find it in the plural, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having convened the Diſciples of <hi>Aſia,</hi> thus juſtifies himſelf to them: <hi>I have kept back nothing from you, but have preached publikly, and</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which may now be more tolerably, thogh not exactly tranſlated) <hi>from houſe to houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I demand any colour of reaſon for this change of number, other than This plain one: <hi>Aſia</hi> was a large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, There were Therein divers Churches in divers Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and it was proper that every City ſhould have it's proper <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and conſequently, the Apoſtle muſt there preach, as from City to City, ſo <hi>from Hous to Hous.</hi> But <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was no more than One, thogh perhaps greater than two or three Cities: and required no more but One, ſo it were a great Meeting-houſe; and There, breaking of Bread might well be celebrated, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in one <hi>Domo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As certainly therefor as the Plural number ſignifieth
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59001:87"/> more than the Singular, and a Large Provnice needeth more Meeting-houſes than a City, and the Apoſtl changeth numbers in conformity to the need; ſo certain it is, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt ſignifie ſuch a Houſe, as is appropriate to ſuch a Meeting and ſuch an Exerciſe.</p>
               <p n="5">V. 4. <hi>THE TIME</hi> when this was do'n, is ſeverally ſtated; one way for <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and another for remoter Churches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. At <hi>Hieruſalem the Apoſtles and Brethren continued Daily in breaking of bread,</hi> as well as <hi>in ſupplication and prayers:</hi> but it was not, could not be ſo in other places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was the Metropolis, There the Apoſtolik College kept their conſtant reſidence; they deſerted their Secular calings, devoting themſelves entirely to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel, preaching in that Mother-city, and thence iſſuing their Emiſſaries and Orders to other Churches. There, <hi>all that believed were together, and had all things common, ſold their poſſeſsions and goods, and parted them to all men as every man had need,</hi> Acts 2.45. and 4.35. This was no more than neceſſary, that thoſe who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their hands, might not be compelled to imploy them with their time for their bodily maintenance: and in conſequence hereof, when all the Believers were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed in Particular, and their common ſtock ſpent, then muſt they be maintained by Contribution from Other Churches, whom their Emiſſaries had converted to the ſame Faith, receiving Carn I things in exchange for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To Theſe Churches therefor another life was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Being to miniſter, not only to their Own neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but to thoſe of the now poor Saints at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> they were caled to Work as well as to Believ. To his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> our Apoſtle preſcribeth, that <hi>in what ever caling any man is caled, he therein abide,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in Gods name;</hi> and to the <hi>Theſſalonians, That if any one would not Work, neither ſhould he Eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59001:87"/>
               <p>Yet, as the poor Saints muſt have a Portion of their Goods, ſo muſt God have of their Time: The Law had directed to the <hi>Seventh day.</hi> Upon that day they Might, and they Did join with the Jews in their Sabbath Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their Synagogs, as the Apoſtls did at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in the Templ: But for <hi>This holy Supper,</hi> That Day was for the ſame reaſon no leſs unfit than That Templ.</p>
               <p>What therefor we ſaid of the neceſſity of another Place, is no leſs true concerning another Day, neceſſary to be conſecrated to this Anti-Jewiſh office. And what Day more proper than the Next, not only neareſt in Time, but ſuperior in Work? On the Seventh day God reſted from his work of Creation, and feſted Himſelf in the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency he receved from the vieu of its perfection. But upon the Firſt day, our Savior triumphed in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the to Him harder, and to Us happier work of our Redemtion. And as this Office was to take it's time after Reading, Preaching and Prayer (as we ſhall ſee more anon) ſo was it congruos that it ſhould ſucceed the Sabbath, conſecrate by the Law to thoſe Offices.</p>
               <p>The next day therefor, as every way fitteſt, is ſet apart for this Greater Myſtery, in memory of our Saviors Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Benefits. This we find expreſly declared, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Upon the Firſt day of the week the Diſciples came together to break bread,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for breaking breads ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for this reaſon was it ſtiled the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to the honor of His Perſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. And in aftertimes, <hi>the day of Bread.</hi> Chryſoſt. Hom. 5. De Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrect.</p>
               <p>And ſince we cannot better manifeſt our Love to him, than by charity to his members; and this Supper was both an Emblem and a Means of mutual Love; therefore muſt it be attended with Liberality to the Poor, recommended ſpecially at this time by our Apoſtl to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as before to his <hi>Galatians;</hi> exhorting; that <hi>Upon the Firſt day of the week, every one ſhould lay by in ſtore as God had
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59001:88"/> proſpered him,</hi> 1 Corin. 16.1, 2.</p>
               <p>And for this conſtantly attending Offertories ſake, no leſs than for the influence they had in promoting mutual love among the Communicants, were theſe ſtiled <hi>Feſts of charity;</hi> under which character St. <hi>Jude</hi> mentions them, as the ordinary exerciſe of all viſible Members of the Church, which els had not be'n ſo obnoxious to the <hi>Spots</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of. Yet ſo incorrigibl was the General ſenſuality, that by <hi>Tertullians</hi> time they were relapſed into the ſame profaneneſs, with that reproved in the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> the Feſts forgot their relation to the Lords Supper, and a while after, were baniſhed out of his Church.</p>
               <p>For ſom Ages did the now dead Sabbath ly in ſtate, not as ſtill in force by vertu of the Law, which it ſelf was dead, but in charity to the Jews; in order to whoſe more probable converſion, Chriſtians complyed with them, as far as lawfully and conveniently they Might; and they Might ſo, in All offices of Natural religion, as in their Templ, ſo on their Sabbath, thogh the Sanctity of Both were equally aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>But with This difference, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were without any Poſitive Command, honored by the Jews as ſo many Chappels of eaſe, even while the Mother-templ ſtood, and therefor were not by the Apoſtl's firſt conſecrate to this office; But the Lords day was never ſanctified by the Jews, nor upon any other account by the Apoſtls, but adaequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this Duties ſake, which gave it both Holineſs and Name, nor as Succeſſor, but Superior to the Sabbath. And this is worthy our conſideration, not only for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's ſake, but the Day's too.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. FOR to derive the LORDS DAY from the fourth Commandment, as it is Inconvenient upon other accounts, ſo is it Miſchievous upon This; that it looſeneth its relation to This office, for who's ſake alone it was dignified, as with the aſſemblies of the Saints, ſo
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59001:88"/> with it's title of the Lord's day: Nor is ſuch an opinion conſiſtent with the practice of the Primitive Church, which for ſeveral ages celebrated Both; the One for the Jews ſake, the Other for the Sacraments, which therefor we ought to celebrate as conſtantly (at leaſt) as we do That day; which cannot be duly (bicauſe it needs not all) be ſanctified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>Were this as carefully heeded, as in Scripture it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, in Reaſon duly accounted for, and in the Primitive times publikly practiſed; both the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and <hi>His Supper,</hi> would have eſcaped Thoſe Loſſes, which Both of them ſuffer by their ſeparation; the One rob'd of it's greateſt Honor, the Other of its very Being.</p>
               <p>For as it is higher Honor to the Day, to be acknowledged an Evangelical Subſtance, than a Legal Shadow, and to be celebrated with this office, than without it; ſo is it not only Leſs Honorable, but More Deſtructive to this Holy office, to be ſpoiled both of the acknowledgement due to it, from the Day ſo preferred by it's intereſt, and of Safety from that Neglect, which could never have befallen it, while the Day it ſelf is ſanctified, if that Sanctification were acknowledged to relate to this Performance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefor who ar zelos for the honor of the Day, are for it's ſake obliged to conſider, whether any Sport, or any Lrbor, can be ſo pernicious a deſecration of it; as the Omiſſion of this Sacrament, who's celebration was the ſole reaſon of the ſacredneſs, both of the Day it ſelf, and of its Eve; which of the two hath the greater intereſt in the Fourth Commandment, as being the ſame Seventh day which Gods peopl celebrated, as thereby conſecrated; yet had not retained any difference under the Goſpel from common days, but in order to the better preparation for the Sacrament, to be receved the Lords day following, and upon That account differenced not by Feſting, but by Faſting.</p>
               <p>And ſince neceſſity may drive to Mean condeſcenſions I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59001:89"/> beg now, not only for the Lord's ſake, but for the Lord's day's ſake, for That day's ſake, in who's behalf ſo many complaints ar made, not only To our Governors, but Againſt them: I beg that thoſe who ar ſo zelous to have the Day reſtored to its due honor, would do their part to reſtore this Sacrament to its due celebration; whereby the Lord's Day, with his Perſon, would be better righted, than by Sabbatizing with Rigot more than Jewiſh, but with Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip leſs than Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſpell all together. The Exerciſes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this conſtant breaking of Bread, Were they not Holy? The Phraſe expreſſing This exerciſe, Is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? The Place, Was it not conſecrated before? The Time, Was it not conſecrated purpoſely? What then can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to the Apoſtls demand, <hi>The bread which they brake, was it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> Or to Our inference? that they were as conſtant in the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as in Common Prayer.</p>

                     <hi>I.</hi> The conſtant Practice of Chriſt's Church in it's beſt ages, proved by one evidence of each kind. <hi>viz. 1.</hi> Canon, the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>FROM Scripture, I am now to deſcend to Humane Writers, to examin whether by Them we find the Practice of the Primitive Churches agreeable to That of the Apoſtls.</p>
               <p n="1">I. AND now I feel ſomthing like a Tentation, to imploy my Servitor to collect what the Fathers (the Eldeſt eſpecially) have writen on This ſubject; and then ſtifling my Reader with a multitude of Quotations, purchaſe my ſelf at Both their coſts, the name of <hi>Well read in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But corage, Reader! I have no more ſuch a Deſign, than my Subject ſuch Need: Where none contradicts, One com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59001:90"/> witneſs of Each kind, may very well claim the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of any indifferent perſon: and with More I will not troubl you. I ſhall therefor produce but One ancient <hi>Canon,</hi> One <hi>Father,</hi> One <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> and One <hi>Enemy,</hi> of each party.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of CANONS, I account Thoſe moſt Ancient, which have uſurped the title of Apoſtolical, thogh many of them bewray themſelves unworthy of it. We have reaſons more than enough to decline their Authority, but None to except againſt Their Teſtimony concerning Mater of Fact, ſuch as is the Publik practice of the Viſibl Church, at the Time of their Date; which is Therefor certainly Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, bicauſe not certainly known, ſince having no Councel to father them, they muſt needs be elder than Any. Of Thoſe Canons, the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> thus briefly and plainly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the opinion we ar pleading for. <hi>All the faithful which enter the Church, and hear the Scriptures, but do not ſtay out the Prayers, nor receve the Holy Communion, ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, as disturbers of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To This ſo clear evidence I know nothing capabl of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſed, unleſs (perhaps) the word <hi>[faithful]</hi> be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to exclude All, but ſuch as deſerv the higheſt ſens of That title.</p>
               <p>But it is ſufficiently know'n, that That comprehenſive word conteineth All but <hi>Catechumens and Penitens:</hi> All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as viſibl Members of Chriſts Body, being in Thoſe days honored with That ſtile.</p>
               <p>And that it ſignifies no otherwiſe Here, the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs ſufficiently evince: For This title is allowed to Thoſe very Perſons, who at the ſame time ar cenſured as worthy of Excommunication.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Laſt clauſe be taken ſo copulatively, as if Thoſe paſſed uncenſured who ſtayed out Prayers, thogh they receved not the Holy Communion: For This was lookt upon as the greater crime of the Two. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Bracara,</hi> required that ſuch ſhould be driven out of the Church: and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> bitterly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59001:90"/> chides them, ſaying, <hi>If thou ſtand by and doſt not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, thou art wicked, thou art ſhameleſs, thou art impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:</hi> And we ſhall preſently ſee, that none could ſtay out the Prayers, but they muſt be at leaſt by-ſtanders at the Communion.</p>
               <p>Or if any thoght to avoid them Both, they were not thereby excuſed, as appears in the caſe of the <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> for when many of them after <hi>reading of the Goſpel</hi> went away, <hi>John,</hi> ſurnamed the Alms-giver, then Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, followed them out of the Church, ſharply reproving them, telling them, He came to adminiſter the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi> to them, and never giving over his importunity, till he brought them back to the Holy Table.</p>
               <p>Even thoſe who were go'n out of the Church as reſolved not to Communicate, and therefor certainly both Unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and Unworthy, did he promiſcuouſly even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>And This zele of ſo Eminent a Prelate, might I vouch as my ſecond Topik, ſince he cannot be denied the title of a <hi>Father of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I urge not This (however Venerable) Authority, further than as Expoſitor of the true meaning of the now mentioned Canon; ſince by the ſhifts the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made to avoid the Letter, by not <hi>[ſtaying out Prayers]</hi> and the importunity the good Prelate uſed, to recal them both to <hi>Prayers and Communion;</hi> we may beſt Avoid any Evaſions, that our Modern Teachers may uſe, who in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Sacrament fright the vulgar from it, and Juſtify my ſelf in my profeſſed endeavor to compel them to it.</p>
               <p>And from the firſt Teſtimony thus cleared, I com to</p>
               <p n="2">II. 2. <hi>ANcient FATHERS,</hi> among whom <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> ſhineth with great luſtre. He floriſhed in the midl of the Second Century, and is ſo Clear and ſo Particular, that his words may ſerv as well to Deſcribe, as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59001:91"/> to Prove the Practice of Thoſe days, conſonant to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This excellent Father</hi> having before deſcribed the other Sacrament, and to its Deſcription added (what the Church conſtantly did to its Celebration) That of the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi> proceeding afterward to giv a Several account of This, he thus reporteth its Conſtant Revolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And That day which is caled [Sunday] there is a meeting of all that dwell in Town and Country, and the Reader having do'n his office, the Preſident makes an Oration, wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the people to imitate ſuch goodly things. Then we all riſe and pray, and (as I have ſaid) at the end of prayers, Bread, Wine and Water are brought forth, and the Prefect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain poureth out with all his might Prayers and Praiſes, and the people anſwereth aloud,</hi> Amen. <hi>And there is a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and communication made of thoſe things, over which thanks have be'n given, to every one that is preſent, but to the abſent it is ſent by the Deacons. But thoſe that are wealthy and willing, contribute what they ſee good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe words do ſo exactly ſuit the Practice of the Church to her above-recited Cenſure, that I know not what Light can be Added, or what Evaſion Pretended, if we conſider how expreſly they declare,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this was Every Sundays exerciſe. And that it was not confined to the Sunday, appeareth by what he had ſaid before in the deſcription of the Other Sacrament, whereof he made This a certain attendant, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that it was do'n only upon Sundays.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Every Chriſtian</hi> was thoght obliged to Communicate <hi>[every Sunday at leaſt]</hi> bicauſe the Church-officers were appointed to cary the <hi>Holy Supper</hi> even to the Abſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They mingled Water with the Wine; This we may very reaſonably believ to have be'n do'n in Conformity to the Jewiſh Tradition; which forbiddeth <hi>the Cup of bleſſing</hi> to be otherwiſe celebrated.</p>

But that you may ſee this was no ſhort lived pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, I ſhall further offer you the teſtimony of a profeſs'd Hiſtorian, that wrote about the midl of the fifth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>Socrates in lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. deſcribing the differences between ſeveral Churches in their Rites, thus ſpeaketh concerning the Subject now in queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Althogh All Churches All the world over, in every week on the Sabbath day celebrate the Communion, yet the</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians <hi>and Romans, upon an ancient Tradition refuſe ſo to do. But the</hi> Egyptians <hi>which dwell near</hi> Alexandria <hi>and in</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais, <hi>celebrate alſo the Communion on the Sabbath, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceve it not after the manner of other Chriſtians; for after they have Feſted, and filled themſelves with ſundry meats, in the Evening making the Offering they Communicate in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here a Teſtimony as full and as clear as can be expected from an Hiſtorian, yea from a Witneſs: for he nether ſpeaketh by hear-ſay, nor tranſcribeth other mens Writings of former ages, but reporteth what himſelf cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew, of the Univerſal practice of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World at the time of his Writing. And for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction, let us conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That He ſhould ſay the Sabbath was the day of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration, whereas <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> puts it upon the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, can make no objection: The analogy between them having given the One the name of the Other in our own days.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Feſted firſt, and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59001:92"/> in the Evening after they had Feſted themſelves, this may well be taken for a continuation of the Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in their Feſts of Charity, baniſhed at That time out of other Churches, bicauſe of rhe abuſes they ſuffered from the Intemperance of the Peopl.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning the ſingularity of the Roman Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not hard to reconcile <hi>Socrates</hi> with St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who ſaith, That in His days there remained plain foot-ſteps of daily Communions in That Church; which alſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth true in Our days, without any contradiction to our Hiſtorian: She hath ſtill evident Foot-ſteps of more than Daily Communions, yet no Face of ſo much as Weekly; It ſeems that even in <hi>Socrates</hi>'s days they had put it in Maskerade.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſee what right That Church hath to ingroſs the title of Catholik: It is one contradiction to confine ſo large a Word to any One part of the World; and it is a Greater to confine it to That part which was ſingular, as differing from All beſides the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We find what pretence that Church hath to equal her Traditions with the Scripture, ſince Univerſality is eſſential to a Tradition, and here ſhe pretendeth One un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the whole Chriſtian World. But moſt pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our preſent purpoſe,</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſee whence we are to derive the neglect of Weekly Communions: When the Roman Church got the Power to impoſe her own Singularities upon All other, the Ambition to uſurp the title of Catholik, as if ſhe were not only the Head but the Whole, and the Confidence to ſet up her Inventions as authentik Traditions; then muſt the Univerſal Practice of All the Chriſtian World be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, and our Lord's Inſtitution be loſt in a private Tradition, and an unintelligibl Maſs: <hi>but in the Beginning it was not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The reſult of all is, That the Doctrine of liberty from obligation to conſtancy in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is Popery
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59001:92"/> moſt properly ſo caled, both in the Mater, and the Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; in the Mater, as differing from the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; in the Derivation, as proceeding from no pretence of Scripture (at firſt, thogh it be otherwiſe now) but from Tradition of their own making, contrary to Tradition worthily ſo caled, and Scripture carefully examined.</p>
               <p>Whoever therefor deſireth a <hi>Thorogh Reformation from Popery and Popiſh Superſtitions,</hi> let him not ſpend his zele about litl Ceremonies and Circumſtances, but imploy it in ſervice of the moſt Sacred and moſt properly Chriſtian office, which needs be reſcued from utter abolition by the Practices of <hi>Rome,</hi> never more groſly ſuperſtitious than in This Subject.</p>
               <p n="3">III. 4. THE Fourth ſort of Teſtimony is That of ENEMIES. Thoſe that appear ſuch to the Conſtancy we aſſert, may be reduced to one of theſe three Glaſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Proteſtants. 2. Papiſts. 3. Junior Fathers.</p>
               <p>Among PROTESTANTS, and Abov all others I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for apply my ſelf to the excellent perſon above praiſed, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know no other that hath aſſerted any thing ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly as to be capabl of an anſwer.</p>
               <p>This admirable Perſon finding the Evidence of the beſt Antiquity, That of the Apoſtl's and Primitive Fathers undeniable, endeavoreth ro Evade what he findeth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Confeſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the Former we have heard him ſay, <hi>True it is, the Apoſtls did indefinitely admit all the faithful to the Holy Communion, but they were perſons wholely enflamed with thoſe Holy Fire, which Jeſus Chriſt ſent from Heaven to make them burning and ſhining Lights,</hi> &amp;c. And then he ſpends a whole Page in ſuch a Character as one might think intended for the Apoſtls themſelves, did not the queſtion neceſſarily caſt it upon the Faithful: and then too, one might think <hi>that word</hi> muſt be taken in its moſt rigid ſens for the Elect.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59001:93"/>
               <p>But was there a <hi>Judas</hi> among the twelve choſen by our Lord himſelf, and not One unworthy among the thouſands of Diſciples, whom the Apoſtls <hi>[indefinitely]</hi> admitted? St. <hi>Jude</hi> deſcribeth not Such Saints (ſure) where, among other black characters, he brandeth them with This, that they <hi>are ſpots in their feſts of charity;</hi> and as litl doth he blame the officers of the Church for admitting them.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> too (I take it) doth not deſcribe <hi>Saintly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> in thoſe Church meetings, for whoſe debaucheries he reproveth, not the Paſtors for Admitting ſuch Perſons, but the Peopl for Committing ſuch Leudneſs; yea, and So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth them, as not to Excommunicate them for their domeſtik riots, but to require them (however unworthy in their perſons) to come, but in a manner more worthy.</p>
               <p>Had the Scriptures be'n ſilent, we muſt have be'n very tame, if without any evidence we had believed; that All Chriſtians, in that (better then Golden) age, deſerved ſo great an Eulogy: but after ſuch contrary Evidence, we have nothing better to do, than to pity ſuch an excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo enſlaved and hardly uſed by an Opinion, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him to ſeek (but alloweth him no) ſhifts from ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportabl Evidence.</p>
               <p>Another Confeſſion (with its annexed Evaſion) concerns the Ancient Fathers in theſe words.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells us, <hi>That even until their days, the cuſtom of receving every day remained in the Churches of</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>And all the ancient Fathers exhort to a frequent Communion: But juſt as Phyſitians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort men to eat the beſt and heartieſt meats; not the ſickly and faint, but the ſtrong men and the healthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the ancient Fathers exhort to a frequent Communion.</hi> This is more than can well ſtand with his own poſitions, which diſcorage the generality from it: yet falls as much ſhort of truth, as <hi>Frequent</hi> doth of <hi>Conſtant:</hi> for we ſhall preſently meet ſom of them exhorting not only to Frequent but Daily Communions.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59001:93"/>
               <p>Yea, ſo certainly did the Primitive Chriſtians make This not only their Conſtant but their Principal exerciſe in All their meetings, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which primarily ſignifieth no more than a <hi>Meeting,</hi> became the diverbial word for the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> in exact conformity to St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s ſtile, who ſaith <hi>They meet to break bread:</hi> and the footſteps of the phraſe remain as plain, yet as much corrupted, as do thoſe of the Office, among the Romaniſts, who expreſs their Church-meetings by <hi>Going to Maſs.</hi> As certainly therefor as the Papiſts make the Maſs the Principal exerciſe of their Publik worſhip, ſo certainly did the Primitive Chriſtians make the Lords Supper the principal of Theirs; the very phraſe confirming their expreſs teſtimony of this truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They exhort men</hi> he confeſſeth, but evades the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence by adding, they do it <hi>Juſt as Phyſicians,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is undeniable, that <hi>They exhorted,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtls ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, All Indefinitely;</hi> and until we are ſhewen that they excepted any, beſides <hi>Catechumens</hi> and <hi>Excommunicates;</hi> we muſt not clip their indefinite Exhortations, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Limitations, derived from no other reaſon but their ſerviceableneſs to our Hypotheſis.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. ANOTHER Claſs of Adverſaries ar the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> who yet no leſs manifeſtly Preſerv, than Contradict, the Primitive Practice; For <hi>That very Church</hi> which obligeth not the Peopl to receve, but at <hi>Eaſter</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That very Church</hi> in whoſe magnified Synod at <hi>Trent,</hi> a Caveat was entered, not to derive even <hi>That anniverſary obligation</hi> from our Lords, but the Churches command; <hi>That</hi> very Church, to <hi>This</hi> very day, ſo Preſcribeth, as to Out-do the conſtancy of the Primitive.</p>
               <p>Som may think it too much, that I have from the <hi>Acts of the holy Apoſtles,</hi> taken the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> for the reaſon of the Diſciples meetings <hi>the firſt day of the week.</hi> But none (ſure) can doubt, that with the Papiſt <hi>[to go to Church]</hi> ſignifieth the ſame, as <hi>[to go to Maſs]</hi> but to go to <hi>[Hear Maſs]</hi> is ſuch an errand as the firſt ages never went upon.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59001:94"/>
               <p>While they admit the people only to hear or ſee, Their <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum]</hi> is an egregiosly; and Both words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be applyed to ſuch a Maſs. To the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple belongs <hi>[This is not to eat the Lords Supper.]</hi> To the Prieſt, <hi>As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you ſhew forth the Lords death.]</hi> And both the One and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſake their Duty and their Patern, while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſtick to them.</p>
               <p>Thus the ruins of a beautiful Structure may at once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence its amplitude, and confeſs their own rubbidge, no way anſwerable to the beauty it formerly ſerved.</p>
               <p>We need not therefor be aſhamed of this kind of proof, as if we too much honored the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Practice for an evidence of the Primitive. We take it, not as the Teſtimony of the Honorable, but as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Guilty, when we make uſe of their Own words as an evidence againſt the Speakers practice.</p>
               <p>When we ſay every Maſs ought to be a Communion, what do we more plainly, than condemn the Private ones, as carrying a Contradiction in the very Terms; and the Publik ones, as carrying One or More in their Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: For they plainly contradict both the word <hi>[Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion]</hi> when there are no <hi>Communicants;</hi> and our Lords Command, while in One Element they Diſpenſe, and in the Other Prohibit what He commanded.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill they do well in the Thing, thogh ill in the Manner; in this very particular deſerving to be owned a true, thogh corrupt Church.</p>
               <p n="5">V. 3. AND what if we now reckon the <hi>Junior Fathers</hi> among our Adverſaries; yea, <hi>Thoſe very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> by name, whom we but now found vouched, as tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, <hi>That the cuſtom of daily Communions continued in ſome Churches until their days?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſuch Fathers, or other credible Writers, ſay of the Doctrines or Cuſtoms of the Churches of Chriſt in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59001:94"/> their own days, we think our ſelves obliged to believe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their credit. And upon that account we doubt not, but This cuſtom of daily Communicating, who's foot-ſteps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Thoſe times wherein they wrote, was derived as Catholik from the preceding: and if themſelves Depart or Detract from what they have ſo witneſſed to be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik, what can we do better, than diſtinguiſh the Doctor from the Father, and judge his Opinion by his Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Whether St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> have ſo do'n, and conſequently how far his authority is to ſway us in the preſent Queſtion, we cannot take a better way to find, than by tranſcribing his own words; the conſequences whereof, were he alive to ſee, he would doubtleſs lament.</p>
               <p>His Diſcourſ is in his 118<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> in theſe words among others. <hi>Som will ſay that the Euchariſt is not to be receved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day: If you ask why? he tells you, bicauſe ſom days ar to be choſen, in which a man may live more purely and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, that ſo he may com to ſo great a Sacrament more worthily; bicauſe he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himſelf. On the other ſide another ſays, If thou haſt received ſo great a wound, and contracted ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent a diſeaſe, that ſuch remedies ar to be deferr'd: every ſuch man ought, by the Authority of the Biſhop, to be removed from the Altar, and put to penance, and by the ſame authority be reconciled. For this is to receve unworthily; Then to receve when a man ſhould be doing penance, and not according to his own pleaſure offer himſelf to, or withdraw himſelf from the Communion. But if his ſins be not ſo great, as to deſerve Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, he ought not to ſeparate himſelf from the daily Medicine of the Lords Body. Between thoſe poſſibly a man may determine the queſtion better, if he admoniſhes that men ſhould abide in the peace of Chriſt. But let every one do what according to his Faith he pioſly believes ought to be do'n. For neither of them diſhonors the Body and Blood of the Lord, if they in their ſeveral ways contend who ſhall moſt honor the moſt holy Sacrament. For</hi> Zacheus <hi>and the Centurion did not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59001:95"/> prefer themſelves before one another, when one receved Chriſt into his houſe, and the other ſaid, he was not worthy to receve him under his roof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That by this Diſcourſe we may undarſtand what was St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Opinion, and how far we are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by it, it will be requiſite that we conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The State of the Queſtion. And 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, His Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Stating the Queſtion, we ar to obſerv. 1. The Queſtion it ſelf. And ſecondly, The Practice of the Church at That time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Queſtion it ſelf is extremely different from Ours: So different, that we may very well ſubſcribe to the Fathers determination. It is, <hi>Whether the Euchariſt be to be receved</hi> EVERY DAY, <hi>or ſome days to be choſen where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man may live more purely,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now we pretend not to EVERY DAY: But believ that the Lords day was purpoſely conſecrate, and afterward other holy days were added, and that every ſuch day hath its <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſet aſide to the purpoſe expreſſed by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, That a man may therein live more purely and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, that ſo he may come more worthily to ſo great a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefor This great Fathers Arbitration which was bounded to Every day, be ſtretched to the modern Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which exceedeth All bounds; nothing will be ſo que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable as This, Whether the injury we do the Fathers Diſcurſ, or That we do our Lord's Inſtitution, be the greater of the two?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Practice of the Church for which the Queſtion was calculated, was extremely different from Ours: and That in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In point of Worſhip. For at Thar time the Holy Communion was daily adminiſtred by the Prieſts (at leaſt in great Cities) and daily received by the devouter part of the peopl. <hi>Som</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf) <hi>Daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59001:95"/> in the body and blood of the Lord, ſome receve upon certain days: in ſome places it is offered every day without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, in ſom only upon the Sabbath and the Lords day, in ſome upon the Lord's day only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the point of Diſcipline, which in Thoſe days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the moſt ſcandalous both from the Communion and publik Prayers: but This by the ſentence of the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>This, as it is plainly intimated in St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s above-recited words, ſo is it more plainly expreſſed by St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> in Theſe words, <hi>Art thou not worthy of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor Communion? thou art not then worthy of Prayer. Thou heareſt the officer ſtanding and proclaiming, Whoever of you are in Penance, be go'n. If thou be one of thoſe that are in Penance, thou muſt not communicate: For he that doth not communicate, is in Penance. Why then doth he ſay, Be go'n you that cannot pray, and thou impudently ſtandeſt by, and art not ſuch, but one of them that can communicate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> two things appear very conſiderable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That thoſe who were excluded from the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, were no leſs ſo from publik Prayer, which by the above-recited account of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> began at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was not left to every mans private Caprice or Conſcience, to Com or Forbear: But every one muſt com, if he were not under Penance by the Biſhops ſentence.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. HITHERTO we have heard St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diſcurſing in the Early ſtile a ueſtion ſuitable to his own time. We ar now to hear him as a Doctor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the Queſtion by his own Reaſon. And we are to obſerv. 1. The ſtile he ſpeaketh in. And 2. The Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination he giveth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His ſtile is not definitive. Doth not give his Sentence, but his Opinion; yea, not his ſetled Opinion, but his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59001:96"/> ſtaggering unfledged Sentiments: Doth not Impoſe upon our Belief, but Propoſe to our Examination: <hi>Between theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>poſſibly a man determine, i. e.</hi> No man hath yet ſo determined, nor can I ſay that any man may, but I offer it to conſideration.</p>
               <p>In This he ſpeaketh moſt like a Father, that he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf Not to ſpeak like one, as not declaring rhe Doctrine of the Church, but his own Private Thoghts, and that how modeſtly! how diffidently! how contrary to his ſtile in other caſes!</p>
               <p>This is not the Only Doctrine, wherein he took the boldneſs to depart from the Opinions of his predeceſſors: and in thoſe caſes he expreſſed himſelf with confidence ſufficiently; why ſo timoros now?</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is as plain as the change. In the Other Queſtions they had not declared their minds plainly; in this they had do'n it not only Plainly but Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had ſaid, <hi>This bread we crave to have</hi> EVERY DAY <hi>given us, lest we who are in Chriſt, and daily receve the Sacrament for the food of Salvation, by interpoſing of any grievos crime, while reſtrained and not communicating, we ar forbidden the Heavenly bread, we ſhould be ſeparated from the body of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Baſil</hi> had ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>To communicate the body and blood of Chriſt</hi> EVERY DAY, <hi>is good and moſt profitable, ſeeing himſelf plainly ſaith,</hi> He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life: <hi>now then, who can doubt, but that often to partake of the life, is nothing elſe, but often to live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had ſaid, <hi>If the Euchariſtical bread be daily offered, why do'ſt thou receve it after a Year, as the Greekt do in the Eaſt? Receve That</hi> EVERY DAY <hi>which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thee every day. So live, that thou mayeſt deſerv to receve every day; He that deſerveth not to receve every day, deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to receve after a year,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:59001:96"/>
               <p>Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> complained, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>So expreſs and ſo earneſt we ſee were the Exhortations of other Fathers, both Before and In St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s time, that as they gave him ſufficient reaſon to be diffident in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his own contrary opinion, ſo do they Us, to except againſt it, as ſingular and out-voted by his equals, if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Truth we have engaged to aſſert: which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it do or not, we are to judge by his Determination, wherein we ar to obſerv, 1. His Deſign. 2. His way of ferving it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Deſign in determining this Queſtion, is the ſame with that of the whole Epiſtl: which is, to perſwade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in matter of worſhip.</p>
               <p>The Peace of Chriſt is dearer to him than his Supper it ſelf which is to ſerv it: and therefor oght principally to be regarded, thogh with it's diminution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rectius inter eos fortaſſe quiſquam dirimit litem qui monet ut</hi> praecipue <hi>in Chriſti pace permaneant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to This only purpoſe doth he bring his inſtance of <hi>Zacheus</hi> and the <hi>Centurion. Ne<expan>

               <p n="2">2. His Way to ſerv this good end, is by a toleration that <hi>every one ſhould do what he thinketh beſt:</hi> which he enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth with This reaſon, that <hi>nether of them diſhonoreth the body of Chriſt, if ſaluberrimum Sacramentum certatim ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norare contendunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which laſt words the good Father may ſeem to unty the obligation I have ſo much contended for. For <hi>if every one may do what he thinketh beſt;</hi> if He do not diſhonor the body and blood of Chriſt, who ſtriveth to honor the Sacrament by forbearance, in ſens of his unworthineſs; then cannot our obligation to conſtancy be indiſpenſibl, but our ſelvs ar judges of what is beſt.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59001:97"/>
               <p>Upon This Authority of ſo great a Father, ſo confirmed with pios reaſon, have following ages proceeded to the modern way of honoring the Lords Supper. Having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ballance Reverence againſt Performance; to make the former the more weighty, they have loaded it with ſo many doubts and difficulties, that he muſt be both very good and very confident, who will not prefer the <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſafe and eaſie complement, before <hi>Zacheus</hi>'s coſtly and troubleſom entertainment. Thus while every one chuſeth to excuſe himſelf <hi>as unworthy that Chriſt ſhould come under his roof,</hi> He may complain <hi>that he hath not where to lay his head:</hi> And All, or at leaſt much of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the too much valuing and too little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the good Fathers words, I thoght to reſcue both the Truth and Him from ſo great and unhappy a miſtake.</p>
               <p>For as Theſe words will not Require, ſo will not his other writing Permit, that we ſhould liſt Him among our Adverſaries; He that caled as loud as any other Father, He that ſo earneſtly expoſtulated with the deſertors of the Holy Sacrament, ſaying, <hi>What is the reaſon, O hearers, that ye ſee the Table and come not to the banquet?</hi> He certainly did not intend to furniſh his hearers with an excuſe, that they did what they thoght beſt, upon the ſame reaſon as did the <hi>Centurion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can we eaſily ſo miſtake, if we regard either the caſe, or his very words: <hi>Inter Eos,</hi> and <hi>Neuter Eorum,</hi> reſtrain his determination to Thoſe two parties between whom he profeſſeth to arbitrate, who both of them might plead ſuch good precedents as might entitle them to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at leaſt. <hi>One thinketh it beſt to communicate Every day, Another thinketh it better to do it only upon ſom certain days:</hi> The Former voucheth the Apoſtls and the <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> Church, who <hi>continued Daily in breaking of Bread, as well as in Prayer:</hi> The Later, the Provincial Churches who <hi>met the Firſt day of the week to break Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how wide is this from our Queſtion, wherein One
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59001:97"/> thinketh himſelf obliged to receive the Holy Sacrament as often as it is offered; and another thinketh himſelf free to take or refuſe it as often as he thinketh fit.</p>
               <p>Whether the good Father would have determined This Queſtion, <hi>Inter Nos,</hi> in the ſame manner as he did That <hi>Inter Eos,</hi> is not ſo apparent, as it is, that his Inſtance can here have no place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zacheus</hi> had a Command from our Lord to come down and entertene him at his houſe: he did ſo, and honored him by the forwardneſs of his Obedience: The <hi>Centurion</hi> had no ſuch command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he honored Him by the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his excuſe. Had <hi>Zacheus</hi> receved no ſuch command, who knows but he might have excuſed himſelf as did the <hi>Centurion?</hi> Had the <hi>Centurion</hi> receved ſuch a command, who knoweth but he would have receved our Lord with the ſame alacrity as did <hi>Zacheus?</hi> Had he not, his own inſtance of his ſervants obedience muſt have condemned him.</p>
               <p>Both of them honored our Lord, but Both cannot be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by Us. For either with <hi>Zacheus</hi> we have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or with the <hi>Centurion</hi> we have None.</p>
               <p>That we have none to receve the Lords Supper EVERY DAY, we willingly acknowledge, and thereby ſubmit to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s determination: But whether we have one to receve it as often as it is celebrated, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we muſt proceed to examin, <hi>The word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> DO.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> The cauſe of our diſobedience to This Command, too much Fear. <hi>II.</hi> We may not commuse Doing for any other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>III.</hi> The Reaſon why ſom think beſt not to do this often, and their appeal to the Church of <hi>England.

The Greek Church in great Churches cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brateth the Holy Communion every Sunday and Holy day. <hi>VI.</hi> Thoſe who omit the Communion it ſelf, greater Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, than thoſe who neglect the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT is meant by DO when joined (as here) with its Object; one would not think ſo hard to Underſtand, as to Miſtake. The force of the <hi>Imperative mode</hi> is ſo know'n to every litl Boy, that it is ſtrange Doctors ſhould miſs it: nor could they, had they not be'n miſ-led by the ſound of Thoſe unhappy words, which I hope now ſufficiently appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to an office contrary to that rhey have ſo long be'n abuſed in.</p>
               <p>If they are not ro be a Defaiſance but Inforcement, then will the Command be for the Form as Abſolute, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibl;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59001:99"/> for the Mater, as Serviceabl to the ends intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and every way as Obliging, as the greateſt Care, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with indiſputable Authority, can poſſibly render Any.</p>
               <p>But it is the ſingular infelicity of This only command, to be Diſobeyed out of too much Regard. We think our ſelves unworthy to Do This: and ar therefor willing to believ we Do better than This, if we pay not Obedience in kind; but by ſom liberal Commutation, make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a gainer, and our Selvs ſecure.</p>
               <p>An error, ſo much the more Excuſabl, bicauſe Natural; Fear of the Divine preſence, is as much Original, and conſequently as Univerſal, as Sin againſt it. Never were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſo heartily obedient to Any law of God, as to That which commanded them to keep Diſtance from the terribl Mount where his Preſence appeared.</p>
               <p>They were ſo willing to forbear Touching, that they would keep out of Hearing; <hi>Speak thou with us</hi> (ſaid they to <hi>Moſes) and we will hear, but let not God ſpeak to us leſt we dy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, not only the common people, and upon ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearances, but even the beſt ſervants of God, and upon his moſt gracious viſits, have be'n frighted at his Preſence. The beſt Prophets fell down at the appearance of a good Angel, and thogh the God-head doubl-veled it ſelf in Fleſh and Poverty, that Humility added to Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might prevent our dazeling; yet when the glory of his Divinity brake throgh, and ſhined in his Miracles, even thoſe who rejoiced in the Benefit, feared the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Centurion,</hi> even when he prayed that his Power and Goodneſs would bleſs his houſe, deprecated his Preſence. When <hi>Peter</hi> had gained a miraculous draght of Fiſhes, the acknowledgement he paid was a Prayer, <hi>That the Lord would depart from him.</hi> And the <hi>Gadarens</hi> (who ſuffer more in their Reputation, than they did in their Swine)
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59001:99"/> fell to the ſame prayer; not more in ſens of their Loſs, than <hi>Peter</hi> did in that of his Gain; but both of them in contrary circumſtances, wer frighted at the ſame ſens of their unworthineſs.</p>
               <p>Were we as uncharitable to our Deſertors of rhe <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> as we generally are to the <hi>Gadarenes;</hi> we might cenſure their Abſence, as the effect of their Covetouſneſs. Poſſibly, ſom may fear the Offertory more than their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, but (ſure) they muſt be very Few.</p>
               <p>We muſt needs believ, moſt mens departure from Chriſt, to be the iſſu of the Same Fear, but not ſo excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable as that of <hi>Peter</hi> and the <hi>Centurion:</hi> For if the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> had really forſaken Chriſt, when he receved his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to follow him; or if the ſame <hi>Centurion</hi> had rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame command with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and denyed obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it; <hi>Peter</hi> muſt have had his portion with <hi>Judas,</hi> and the <hi>Centurion</hi> with the inhoſpitabl <hi>Samaritans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. AND this is our preſent caſe <hi>[Do this]</hi> is no leſs Imperative to us, than <hi>[Follow thou me]</hi> was to <hi>Peter;</hi> or <hi>[com down to entertene me]</hi> was to <hi>Zacheus.</hi> It leav's us not at liberty to do Any thing elſe in ſtead of This. We may as litl Commute, as Omit the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when the Word of command pointeth out as well the Object as the Act.</p>
               <p>Had our Lord ſaid, Honor this, or Contemplate this, or Admire this, or Adore this, or Dread this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had he left to our choice, whether we would pay in Kind or in Value: we muſt needs have juſtified rhe Chriſtian World, not only for a Juſt paymaſter but a Liberal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. So induſtrioſly have men taxed All their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for an ample Contribution; their Inventions, for Myſteries; their Fancies, for Alluſions; their Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for Condicions; their Affections, for Ardor: I wiſh they had moderated that ardor, not permitted it to break out into devouring Flames, to deſtroy ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59001:100"/> merely bicauſe they could not tranſlate <hi>[Do this]</hi> into <hi>[Worſhip this.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strange! that in a command ſo Poſitive and ſo Plain, the Teachers themſelvs ſhould no better have learned what That meaneth, <hi>To obey is better than Sacrifice.</hi> And I know not which may claim more of our admiration, the ſtrange Agreement among the otherwiſe moſt irreconcileable Sects of Chriſtians, in their joint reſolution to Commute; or the ſtrange Difference in the Sacrifices they bring, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to the pioſly injured Command.</p>
               <p>I paſs by the Papiſts, who commute Obedience to This command, into Diſobedience to Another; paying forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Adoration, inſtead of commanded Eating; and the Non-conformiſts, who in ſtead of Obedience to our Lord, pay Diſobedience to his Officers, refuſing to <hi>Do this,</hi> leſt they ſhould do it in Circumſtances, for This only reaſon to be Shunned by themſelves, bicauſe Required by their Governors.</p>
               <p>I aſs by Both Theſe, and All Others, but Thoſe of our Own (I wiſh I could call it) Communion; who owning the Command of our Lord, and the Authority of our Church; profeſſing conformity to Both, diſobey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in its own Defence, and ſhelter themſelves under the protection of the Church, pretending her to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>three times in a year,</hi> ſufficient; and therefor more than Three times, needleſs.</p>
               <p>Had they appeled to St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> they had met ſom ſound of words, that by help of Inferences, might have afforded them ſom color. He did (indeed) firſt hang up the ſcales between theſe contrary ways of honoring our Lord, and left the <hi>Centurion</hi> aequilibrate to <hi>Zacheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now almoſt all the weight is taken out of the One ſcale, and caſt into the Other; the Obligation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance made ſo Light, and the Conditions of worthineſs ſo Heavy, that it is Now queſtioned, Not whether we ar to receve Every day? but Any day? And what St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59001:100"/> thought not Poſſibl to be queſtioned, is now too Generally believed; <hi>viz.</hi> that there muſt be a choice, not only of ſom Days, but ſom Perſons above Others.</p>
               <p>Concerning the required worthineſs of Perſons, I ſhall meet a fitter time to ſpeak more fully: I am now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning Times, whether we are obliged to take All? or Any? or Few? or Many?</p>
               <p>In which Queſtion, we ar grow'n very much bolder than St. <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> He Queſtioned, but durſt not Determin between Every day and Som days: we boldly Determin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Daily, yea Weekly, yea Monthly Communions; but ſtabliſh not Any at all.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>IT is manifeſt</hi> (ſay ſom) <hi>that Scarceity advanceth, and Plenty abateth the valu of every thing. Thoſe acts of worſhip which are Frequently, are alſo Slightly performed; and ſince we cannot keep Both, we were better quit Frequence than Reverence. For we ſhall more honor our Lord by doing this more Reverently thogh leſs Frequently, Than more Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with leſs Reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in confirmation hereof, they vouch not only Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which ſheweth that Thoſe very perſons, who ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard to enjoy the Common Prayer, when it was not to be had without difficulty, contemn it, now it is truly Common: but (as we com now from ſaying) the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Church too, as ſatisfied with <hi>[three times in a year.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is their Opinion, and thus they defend it. It were heartily to be wiſhed that the Antecedent wer as fals as the Conſequent is weak: That there wer as litl Truth in the alleged contemt of Common Prayer, as there is Reaſon thence to be draw'n againſt making the Communion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as That.</p>
               <p>And it were further to be wiſhed, that thoſe who thus pretend to hear the Church, would better conſider her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Judgment.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59001:101"/>
               <p>But This conceit, grave as it looks, with its countenance of Piety and Prudence, we have found to be the very ſame with that in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> againſt which the Apoſtle leveleth his whole Argument: And plauſibl as it looks, with its Countenance of Conformity to the Church, we ſhall find it more guilty of Non-conformity, than what is by its patrons condemned as ſuch: And ſo much the more injurious to the Church, bicauſe it doth not only rob her of het Authority, but her Innocence; as making her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the diſobedience ſhe condemns.</p>
               <p>And ſince I ow a duty to the Church, as well as to the Queſtion, I ſhall not proceed further, 'till I have vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Her from ſo great Suſpicion, and This from ſo great a Prejudice, as by This pretence they ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. CONCERNING the ſens of our Church in this Queſtion, it is ſtrange that there ſhould be any Doubt, much more that there ſhould be any Error, ſo plainly doth ſhe declare it in her Offices and Rubriks relating to this Sacrament: preparatory whereto, ſhe hath provided two Exhortations; the One ſhewing the danger of Unworthineſs, the Other of Forbearance: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the doubl charge of the Apoſtl, <hi>Let a man examin himſelf, and ſo let him eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt this is News to Them who moſt are concerned in it. For if they had do'n the Church and Themſelvs the right, to Read and Conſider That Exhortation, which ſhe hath appointed to be read when the Miniſter ſhall ſee the peopl negligent to come; they muſt needs be convinced, if not how great the Error is, yet certainly, how litle the Church favoreth it.</p>
               <p>For what can be ſaid to This Invitation? <hi>In Gods behalf I bid you All</hi> (All indefinitely) <hi>and beſeech you for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake that you will not refuſe to come, being ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly caled, and bidden by God himſelf.</hi> And again, <hi>I bid you in the name of God, I call you in Chriſts behalf, I exhort
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59001:101"/> you as you love your own ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What to this Warning? <hi>Take you heed, lest you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing your ſelves from this Holy Supper, provoke Gods indignation againſt you.</hi> And again, <hi>Conſider with your ſelvs how great an injury you do to God, and how ſore puniſhments hangeth over your heads for the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What to this Argument? <hi>You know how grievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind a thing it is, when a man hath prepared a rich Feſt, deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Table with all kinds of proviſione, ſo that there lacketh nothing but the gueſts to ſit down, and yet they who are caled moſt unthankfully refuſe to come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which of you in ſuch a caſe would not be moved? who would not think a great injury and wrong do'n unto him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What to the cloſe of all? <hi>Theſe things if ye earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ye will by Gods grace return to a better mind; for the obtaining whereof we ſhall not ceaſe to make our humbl peticions to Almighty God our heavenly Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Invitation is Univerſal, <hi>I bid you All.</hi> The charge lieth upon All Perſons, and at All Times. For <hi>as often as</hi> the peopl (the peopl in general) are Negligent to com, ſo often is the Miniſter thus to reprove and warn them, and there is no limitation to diſpenſ with Any Perſon, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Any Time.</p>
               <p>Thus, thus it is that the Church incourageth us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſ with our Duty; thus ſhe diſcourageth Conſtancy in it: Thus ſhe ſetteth up Reverence againſt Frequency.</p>
               <p>But ſince Error cannot ſubſiſt without borrowing from Truth; let us ſee, what appearances there may be of the Churches countenance in the contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>She declareth (ſay they) <hi>three times in a year</hi> to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Churches, as well as States, ar many times neceſſie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tated to comply with the ungovernabl humors of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And what if our Church have do'n in This Subject, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did in That of Divorce, <hi>bicauſe of the hardneſs of the peopls hearts?</hi> chuſing a great inconvenience, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59001:102"/> from a yet greater miſchief?</p>
               <p>The indevotion of the peopl is ſo incorrigibl, that ſhe ſaw too great reaſon to fear, leſt if ſhe ſhould exact the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy due to it, ſhe ſhould thereby rather draw contemt, then Gueſts to the Holy Table: and therefor, leſt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring All, ſhe ſhould loſe All, thoght neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate her ſelf, not to what our Savior Requireth, but to what ſhe might hope to Obtene.</p>
               <p>This appeareth by the two firſt Rubriks, which caution againſt expoſing the Sacrament, if there be not a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number to communicate; <hi>i. e.</hi> if there be not the ſame number which is neceſſary for the Grace-cup, for ſo is the number expreſly determined, to three at leaſt. And if ſhe thus doubted of Three, when it is ſo Seldom; what could ſhe hope if it were Conſtantly celebrated?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where ſhe may Hope more, ſhe Requires more. She doth not think the Prieſts more Obliged to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but more Likely to be devout and obedient, than the People: When therefor there is a competent number of ſuch (as in Colleges and Collegiat Churches there often is) where they cannot want Opportunity, if they want not Piety; There ſhe requireth, not only <hi>three times every Year,</hi> but <hi>once every Week;</hi> and in This requiring of the Prieſts, ſhe doth more than intimate what oght to be do'n by All; thogh ſhe forbear to enjoin it, bicauſe of the too juſtly ſuppoſed hardneſs of the hearts of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nether is ſhe ſatisfied with This, either in Prieſt or Peopl. When ſhe ſaith it muſt be thus often <hi>[At leaſt]</hi> ſhe doth not declare This to be the Moſt that is required by our Lords Inſtitution, but the Leaſt that can ſatisfie her Own Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who com not So often <hi>[At leaſt]</hi> muſt be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ee as Non-conformiſts; thoſe who com not much Oftner, thogh they fall not under her Diſcipline, do under her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, as we com now from hearing.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59001:102"/>
               <p>We can no more infer <hi>Three times a Year</hi> ſufficient for the Communion, bicauſe the Church doth not puniſh thoſe who come ſo often; than <hi>Once in a month</hi> to be ſufficient for Divine Service, becauſe the Law puniſheth not thoſe who com ſo often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rules of Government,</hi> have meſures different from <hi>Rules of Devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Church ſeemeth to have taken her meſures from the Council of <hi>Agatho</hi> and <hi>Eliberis,</hi> which declare, That thoſe who do not communicate on the Feſts of <hi>Nativity, Easter,</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> are not to be accounted Catholik.</p>
               <p>She manifeſtly declareth her judgment to agree with what we have all this while be'n proving. Not every <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> but almoſt for every other <hi>Holy day;</hi> ſhe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a preparative <hi>Vigil,</hi> that we may examin our ſelvs with Faſting and Prayer; and every Feſtival hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Communion Service, to be read at the Time and Place of the Lords Supper. Juſt in the ſame circumſtances as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> hath deſcribed the practice of the Church in His days; when the Reader and Preacher have do'n their offices, when the Catechumens are diſmiſſed with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Then doth the Prieſt go to the Holy Table, accompanied in <hi>Collegiat Churches and Chappels</hi> with one or two aſſiſtants, There to read the Communion Service every Holy day throughout the year.</p>
               <p n="5">V. LET us now ſuppoſe a Prieſt of ether party, about to read the Communion Service at the Holy Table, declaring what he believeth to be the Churches meaning in that office, and it will not be hard to judge which of the two will beſt deſerv her thanks.</p>
               <p>He that will make her ſatisfied with his three times in a year, muſt ſpeak to this purpoſe: <hi>Behold, hither am I com'n in conformity to the Cuſtoms of the Primitive Church, and the Conſtitutions of our own. The firſt Churches celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59001:103"/> the Lords Supper every Holy dry, and Ours ordaineth the Communion Service to be read every ſuch day, in the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. After the Benediction, with an Offertory, at the Holy Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here am I, and my brethren ready to aſſiſt me, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to you and with you. If any</hi> Iſaac <hi>demand, Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the Lamb? Here are all other requiſites, but where is the Bread and Wine? Know that our Church doth as litl intend a Communion, as</hi> Iſaac <hi>did to be Sacrificed. She doth not indeed affront your ſences by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating the Elements, without Communicating them, as doth the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but ſhe is no leſs willing to withold them from you. She is content you ſhould communicate thrice every Year, that the memory of the Inſtitution be not quite loſt; but would have you mannerly and modeſt, not constant and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gueſts: com by ſuch intervals, as may becom the awe due to ſo venerable a Mystery, not with ſuch conſtancy as may ſignifie familiarity with it. For however our Lord intended (and the Apoſtls and beſt ages of the Church conformed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to his Intentions) that his Supper ſhould be the conſtant of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in every Church meeting; yet experience hath proved ſuch Conſtancy prejudicial to its Honor; and therefor our Church hath taken this midl away, conſtantly to do ſomwhat in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Lords Inſtitution, yet to forbear the complete of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in reverence to his body and blood, that as plenty hath made it cheap, ſo ſcarcity may advance its value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe muſt ſuch an one ſpeak that will father ſuch an opinion upon the Church.</p>
               <p>But he that pleads for conſtancy, may borrow a better ſpeach from St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who complains, <hi>Here we wait, and none com;</hi> or from St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who expoſtulates, <hi>What cauſe is there, O hearers, that ye ſee the Table and com not to the Banquet?</hi> Yea, or from her Own Exhortation now mentioned, which aſſiſted with her Rubrik preſcribing to the Prieſts once every week at the leaſt; will complain, not only of deſerting the Table, when furniſhed, but of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraging
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59001:103"/> the Miniſters from furniſhing it, as conſtantly with the Holy Feſt, as they do with the Office which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it.</p>
               <p>For thus may ſuch an one ſpeak,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here we attend in conformity to our Lords Inſtitution, the Practice of the Primitive Church, and the Injunctions of our Own, to communicate with you the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We do not indeed bring forth the Bread and Wine, bicauſe it is too manifeſt, that in ſo doing, we must either expoſe them to contemt, by not uſing them at all, or uſe them our ſelves alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The choice is hard, and the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath choſen the Later, but without eſcaping the Former; For how can That be caled a Communion (as by the Apoſtl it is) where One takes all to himſelf; or how is the holy Supper reſcued from contemt, when all but one are idle ſpectators, not vouchſafing to be gueſts at the divine Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Church hath taken the beſt courſ, that in ſo great a ſtreight ſhe could, to avoid Both ſides of the inconvenience. That our Lords body &amp; blood may not be ſo expoſed, ſhe forbids us to celebrate the Communion unleſs there be a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to communicate: and to avoid loſs of any opportunity, ſhe directs thoſe who intend to communicate, that they ſignifie their readineſs, by ſending their names in convenient ſeaſon to the Curate: By the One ſhe provides, that the Feſt be not diſhonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of Gueſts; and by the Other, that the Deſirous be not hindered for want of the Feſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And leſt this omiſſion of bringing Bread and Wine, ſhould be miſtaken for an intimation, that it is not our duty to receve them; ſhe hath provided that upon Every Holy day, we be put in mind of our Obligation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yeſterday Eve was conſecrate to Faſting and Prayer; for This very purpoſe, that we might thereby prepare our ſelvs to receve the Holy Supper this day. And now, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer is ended, and the reſt of the people (who are not capable to communicate) ar diſmiſſed with their bleſſing; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59001:104"/> to the practice of Chriſt's Church in the beſt ages, we com up to the holy Table, in this its proper place and ſeaſon, to read the Communion-ſervice; that you may underſtand there oght to be a Communion joined with This Service, if you would not be wanting to your duty in receiving it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You know we dare not adventure to expoſe the holy Viands, without giving you a weeks warning: nor dare we give you ſuch warnings, as Frequently as we deſire, much leſs as Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly as we ought, bicauſe we ſind you too backward to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene, even Thoſe too rare Invitations which we give you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that you may ſee with what regret we ſubmit to That neceſſity you thus put upon us; Our Church is careful clearly to intimate, how much more ſhe Wiſheth, than ſhe Dareth to Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What reaſon can you imagin, for her putting ſo great a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between her Injunctions to the Prieſts, and thoſe to the People? By our Lords Inſtitution, ether the People are not at all obliged, or they are cqually ſo, with the Priests: Why then ſhould Three times in a year be ſufficient for the One, and no leſs than Every Sunday for the Other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There can be no other reaſon but This, that thogh there be not more Due, yet there is more to be Hoped, from the Prieſts. From them therefor ſhe requireth, that when they have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, they communicate every Sunday [At leaſt] And how much more they might (and would do better to) exceed that [Leaſt] This Communion-ſervice plainly declareth: whereby our Church keepeth up the claim to that conſtancy which in the Primitive Church was practiced, of cloſing every Church-jeſt with the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Would you duly heed it, you could not miſs either the Churches Doctrine concerning your duty, or opportunities to perform it. She hath plainly enogh ſhew'n her Readineſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Her part, and Your obligations to do Yours. Try us, Try us by the way ſhe hath directed, Signifie your willingneſs by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us your names; and if you then have not as many Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as Communion-ſervices, let the whole blame lie upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59001:104"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But while on the Churches part there are ſuch Invitations, and on Your part ſuch neglects, She may well take up St.</hi> Paul's <hi>ſelf-juſtification,</hi> Your blood be upon your own heads, I am clean.</p>
               <p>Such muſt the Languages be of thoſe that on either ſide ſhall pretend the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s authority: and if it can be queſtionable which of the two is the better Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor of her Rubriks, poſſibly it cannot be put to a better Umpirage (if it need any) then that of our Univerſity. And by her Statutes the Communion-ſervice is never read in the Univerſity-Church without a Communion, nor the Common Prayer without them Both.</p>
               <p>Theſe Statutes have added Holy days of Our own to thoſe of the Church, but ſtill with conformity to This rule.</p>
               <p>We begin every Term, as with Common Prayer, ſo with the Communion. Nothing therefor can be more apparent than the ſens of the Univerſity, which (ſure) you cannot think ignorant of the Churches Doctrines.</p>
               <p>And it may be worth ſom conſideration, that this is the practice of the Greek Church to this very day in their great Churches. For thus ſaith the Learned Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> an ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar witneſs. <hi>At ſuch ſolemnities the holy and auguſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is alway celebrated, and that with great pomp and ce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: and indsed is not only a neceſſary, but the principal part of the Feſtival.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that we may not miſtake, as if this were ſpoken only of the Principal Feſts, he ſaith afterward upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, <hi>In the great Churches the Prieſts celebrates the Sacrament upon the ſolem Feſtivals, and upon Sundays, and at other times upon occaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the obligation of the Peopl alſo, they com not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, but advance a ſtep further than our Church; for ſaith the ſame Author, <hi>The Laiks ace obliged to receve the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament four times a year. With which law of their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59001:105"/> Church they moſt readily comply, none omitting it, eſpecially at</hi> Chriſtmas <hi>or</hi> Eaſter, <hi>unleſs hinder'd by real and urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. In order to their better preparation, the preceding Feſts (i. e.</hi> the four Lents fore-ſpoken of) <hi>are appointed and obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. AND let me provoke the otherwiſe-minded to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. Will they own ſuch Miniſters for Conformiſts (if ſuch there be) as for many Months, and perhaps whole Years together, Omit to read the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Service? will they not think it the duty of the Church-wardens to Preſent, and of the Biſhop to Puniſh ſuch, as Diſobedient to the Churches Orders, and Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of her Offices? Why then muſt They Eſcape Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment? yea, why muſt they paſs for the beſt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who for Months, and perhaps whole Years together, omit either Offering or Receiving That Communion, which That Service profeſſeth to celebrate; and ſo by Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the One, Expoſe the Other?</p>
               <p>Let thoſe now, who boſt themſelves the tru Sons of the Church, ſhew themſelvs ſuch, not by much Talking, but Studying her Thoghts, yea, her Declarations. A good ſon will act, not only the expreſs Commands, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of his Parent: he will Enquire, and by all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent indications Search; and where there are manifeſt tokens, that More is Deſired than Expreſſed, will do not only what the Command makes Neceſſary, but whatever ſuch Indications ſhew to be Well-pleaſing.</p>
               <p>Since therefor the Church ſo plainly intimateth, that ſhe Recommendeth More then ſhe dares Command; how can Thoſe pretend themſelves her affectionate Sons, who do not only Neglect to comply with her ſo clear Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but downright Diſobey Thoſe Commands, which ſhe plainly impoſeth as Neceſſary to her Communion?</p>
               <p>Where is now that zele for the Church? Have we no better way to ſhew it, than by contending for a Veſture, or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59001:105"/> a Geſture? Do we think her ſuch a coquet, as to prefer a Ribon or a Lace before her Neceſſaries?</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not this to juſtifie any Neglect or Diſobedience toward the ſlighteſt Injunctions of our Governors; but by comparing the weightier maters of the Law, with <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, mint and cummin;</hi> to prove that Thoſe who ar earneſt to have <hi>theſe things do'n, oght not to leave the other undo'n.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might further urge, that Thoſe ar the worſt ſort of Non-conformiſts, who not only Deny Obedience, but Slander Thoſe very Conſtitutions which require it: and ſo make themſelvs not only Diſobedient children, but Falſe accuſers: for they can hardly avoid that dubl character, who both refuſe to communicate with her in This (of all others moſt ſacred and ſolen) office, and accuſe her as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to That very Diſobedience which themſelvs pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, no leſs againſt Her Injunctions than our Lords.</p>
               <p>But it is not my buſineſs to <hi>accuſe my brethren,</hi> further than is neceſſary to the <hi>vindicating of my mother;</hi> which I hope I have abundantly do'n, ſo as to be ſecure from having her Name abuſed, to the protection of an Error ſo Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to her Conſtitutions.</p>

               <p>HAVING thus do'n right to our Church, I now com to do it to the Queſtion: which is not the ſame in Our days as in St. <hi>Auguſtin's.</hi> It is nor, <hi>whether we ought to receve every Day?</hi> but, <hi>Whether we ought to do it upon every opportunity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How frequent thoſe Opportunities ought to be, it is not the Peopl's buſineſs to enquire, nor mine to determin. It muſt needs be as neceſſary for the Officers, as for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Church, to yield to the invincibl hardneſs of the peopl's hearts.</p>
               <p>In ſo corrupt an age, we may not ſtand upon our Lords <hi>[In the beginning it was not ſo]</hi> but yield to his <hi>[Suffer it to be ſo now.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I therefor urge no more but this, <hi>That it is the duty of every Miniſter, to labor with his people to com conſtantly, and to offer the Holy Communion as often as he can prevail with them to receve it.</hi>

               <p n="2">II <hi>MOral Laws</hi> ar written in the <hi>fleſhly tables of the heart,</hi> whoſe yielding nature may take impreſſion from the various occurrences of life.

               <p>For the Philoſopher cannot ſo fix the bounds of Vertu, but that (in many caſes) the Determination of a Prudent man is neceſſaty to diſtinguiſh it from Vice.</p>
               <p>But God wrote his Poſitive Laws in Tables of Stone, whoſe rigor was uncapabl of yielding. Of ſuch Laws, the Will of the Law-giver was the Only Reaſon, and muſt be the Only Meſure. We muſt do <hi>Juſt ſo, no leſs, nor no more, nor no otherwiſe.</hi> Reaſon hath here nothing to do, but to deny it ſelf to have the leaſt power to Diſpenſ, or Derogate, or Commute, or any way Decline from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs voice of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uzzah</hi> could not then plead the appearance of neceſſity, or the evidence of his good meaning; when the danger of the Law was greater one way, than that of the Ark was the other way.</p>
               <p>To this ſurpoſe ler us reflect upon what we have already obſerved; that our <hi>Apoſtl</hi> vouched our <hi>Lord's authority,</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:59001:107"/> that ſo he might aſſert both the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Importance</hi> of what he delivered: For we cannot now deny the <hi>Truth,</hi> without affronting the Apoſtl's veracity, nor the <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> without diſparaging our Lord's wiſdom; for the One muſt be ſaid to take <hi>great care</hi> for a ſubject of <hi>no valu,</hi> or the Other report a <hi>falſhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſeen ſom danger that our Lord's mind might be miſtaken, as if he either intended to conſecrate <hi>none</hi> but <hi>the Paſchal Supper,</hi> or valued the <hi>whole office</hi> at no higher rate, than he uſed to do <hi>outward performances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need no other evidence, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might probably believ This; than the <hi>commonneſs</hi> of This belief <hi>now,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>Apoſtl's</hi> indeavor to confute it in <hi>both</hi> its <hi>members,</hi> by This declaration, which plainly diſcovereth, <hi>how much</hi> our Lord valued this office, <hi>how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> we muſt perform it, and <hi>how litl power</hi> we have to abate any thing of it.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons he doth not plead here, as before in another caſe of outward decency, Doth not appeal to <hi>Their</hi> Judgments, nor offer his <hi>Own:</hi> ſaith not, as <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>[I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge you what I ſay]</hi> nor as <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>[I give my judgment] This ſay I, not the Lord;]</hi> but quite contrary <hi>[This ſay not I, but the Lord]</hi> and the conſequence is, <hi>Neither I nor an Angel from heaven</hi> muſt be <hi>believed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Revelation; Neither I nor an Angel from heaven</hi> (much leſs a mans own humor) can any way relax the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
               <p>Grant therefore now that the Obſervation be as Tru, as the Subject is Unhappy: ſuppoſe <hi>Frequence</hi> bring danger of <hi>Cheapneſs:</hi> muſt we therefor preſume to make it <hi>Scarce?</hi> No doubtleſs!

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59001:107"/> declare himſelf both Superior and Wiſer? <hi>If thou judg the Law</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>James) thou art not a Doer of the law, but a Judge.</hi> I may add, Thou art not only a Judge, but an Unjuſt one; if thy ſentence rob the law of it's <hi>due:</hi> &amp; ſo much more ſo, by how much <hi>greater care</hi> our Lord took to have it <hi>duly paid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. HE therefor <hi>that breaketh</hi> This, which is not <hi>the Leaſt of our Lords Commandments, and teacheth men ſo,</hi> muſt be weighed in others ſcales, than thoſe of St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> Not compared with the modeſt <hi>Centurion,</hi> or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Zacheus,</hi> but with the moſt Diſobedient Rebel, and the moſt Unworthy Communicant: and even ſo will be found more inexcuſable than the worſt.</p>
               <p>For he that <hi>Doth This, however unworthily,</hi> payeth Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of obedience, owneth our Lords Authority, &amp; is eaſily Convinced of his Crime: But he that ſaith he <hi>needs not do it,</hi> doth not only deny the Law, to have power over himſelf; but aſſumeth to himſelf power over the Law; and renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Need, (and therefor all Benefit) of Repentance.</p>
               <p>He that Diſobeyeth the Kings Law, may be a Felon; but he that ſetteth up an Oppoſit Authority, is a Rebel; and declaring himſelf (as all Rebels do) a moſt Faithful Subject, is thereby the more Unpardonabl. He that <hi>[doth this] unworthily,</hi> is guilty of the <hi>body and bloud of the Lord,</hi> he diſhonoreth his Perſon, and that in his Humanity; but he that Renounceth any Obligation to do it, is guilty of his Crown and Dignity; Depoſeth him from his Throne, and affronteth the Majeſty of his Divinity: and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Reaſon for diſobedience, whether it be Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or his Teachers Authority, or what ever els it be; it is a Rival to obedience, and it's plauſibl Pretences make it ſo much the more properly Rebellious.</p>
               <p>This perhaps may ſeem too Severe; I grant it, nor do I believ our Lord judgeth according to ſuch Rigid me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but Rigid as they ar, they ar Juſt, and may be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the Doctrines, thogh not againſt the Perſons.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59001:108"/> For if the Preformance be bound upon us by a Poſitive Law of Chriſt; and Forbearance, only by my Own or my Teachers Reaſon; If I prefer This abve That, and Juſtifie my doing ſo; what is this but to ſay, I will not have <hi>That,</hi> but <hi>This to reign over me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may not therefor without manifeſt Depoſing our Lord, pretend any thing Equal to his Authority; but if we will decline our obedience to This Command, we muſt fetch our Warrant from That alone, as diſpenſing with us in ſuch caſes as we oppoſe to our obligation.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. AND this Warrant muſt be as Expreſs as his Command; and it muſt be either a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or a Diſpenſation.</p>

               <p>If it be not poſſibl to do this without breaking ſome O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (no leſs evident) Law; This will amount to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Countermand: For then will This Law loſe all its weight, by the equal Counterweight of That Other; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ the Same Lord who ſaid <hi>[Do This]</hi> will have ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>[Do Not That;]</hi> and when ſuch a Counter-Law is Pleaded and Proved, we muſt acquieſce.</p>
               <p>But Where? Where in the name of Chriſt is ſuch a Counter-Law? In what Book, whar Chapter, what Verſ, do we find him ſay, <hi>[Do Not This?]</hi> Pretences we find in abundance; but where do we find them Authoriſed? Where is it written, <hi>Do not this,</hi> if there be a <hi>Judas</hi> in the company! <hi>Do it not,</hi> if you may not do it without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your <hi>liberty in things indifferent?</hi> Do it not, if you may not do it in ſuch Manner, ſuch Forms, ſuch a Place, ſuch Company, ſuch Geſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as your ſelves like Beſt. Do it not, if the Form of Adminiſtration have any Mixture of humane Ordinances, or the Aſſembly any mixture of Profane or Suſpicios Perſons? Or (which is the ſame Kind, thogh not the ſame Color) Do it not as Often as you have Opportunity, if you believ your Often doing it, will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion your doing it Leſs Reverently.</p>

               <p>If in any of Theſe, or any Other caſes, we find any ſuch Expreſs, or Implicit Countermand, as with equal Clearneſs of Words, and equal Evidence of Sens, and equal Abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Command, can ballance our Lordr <hi>[Do this]</hi> we muſt yeild; but els, whatever weight is Wanting in the Oppoſite Scale, is Left in the Obligation.</p>
               <p n="5">V. 2. AND the ſame rule alſo holdeth in the Other kind of Warrant. If we pretend our ſelfs not Countermanded but Diſpenſed wth; we muſt have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word declaring us ſo in That particular caſe.</p>

               <p>There is indeed an <hi>Expreſs word,</hi> which hath <hi>too long</hi> and <hi>too generally</hi> be'n taken for an <hi>

               </p>
               <p>He declareth it a great crime to do this <hi>Unworthily,</hi> and for That reaſon warneth us to <hi>Examin our ſelfs:</hi> and from hence ſome haſtily infer, That if we have be'n <hi>hindered</hi> from This <hi>Preparation;</hi> and ſome others, that if we have neglected it; then ar we, not only Excuſed, but Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bired from the Performance.</p>
               <p>And whoever hath any kindneſs for his <hi>Sloth</hi> or his <hi>Sins,</hi> very Plauſibly perſwades himſelf, That the Indulgent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtl hath left a wide door open, to admit what he pleaſe

               <p>But This very <hi>Unpreparedneſs</hi> is it ſelf a Violation of an Expreſs Precept: <hi>[Let a man examin himſelf, and ſo let him eat]</hi> is a doubl Precept; but ſo, that Either Member is an Entire Precept by its ſelf, without retaining to the Other, as it's condicion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>God commanded the Jews to eat the Paſsover <hi>with their loins girt:</hi> Wer it not ridiculos to think, that if one be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt,</hi> he is free, both from the Obligation and the Threat; ſo that notwithſtanding them Both, <hi>That ſoul ſhall not be cut off from his peopl!</hi> The <hi>Girding</hi> of the <hi>Loins</hi> is often u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as an expreſſion of <hi>Preparation;</hi> and the defect of <hi>That,</hi> may as well excuſe from the <hi>Paſsover,</hi> as the defect of <hi>This,</hi> from the <hi>Lords Surper.</hi>

AND at This rate of pleading, we may as well excuſe our ſelves from All Religios Exerciſes whatſoever, bicauſe we cannot in any of them make Any addreſs to God unworthily, without affronting him. That our Partiality and Injuſtice toward This Sacrament may the more plainly appear, let us for a minute or two ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (what probably the <hi>Corinthians</hi> believed) that it was not concerned in thoſe Meetings, wherein they behaved
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59001:109"/> themſelves ſo irreverently: and Then conſider, whether the ſame reproofs may not be tranſplanted into ſuch Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, upon as good grounds, and with as good fruit: Might he not have pleaded with the ſame Evidence of reaſon, and even in the ſame words?</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as often as you pray to God, you addreſs your ſelves to his Throne, and to him that ſitteth thereon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For he that prayeth to God unworthily, prayeth for damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf, not regarding the Majeſty of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What think you? Were any of theſe reproofs too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere? Any of thoſe Warnings needleſs? Any Precept for ſelf-examination ſuperfluos? Or do All of them amount to a diſpenſation from worſhipping God in his Houſe?</p>
               <p>May we not then take up the ſame Apoſtl's Language, expoſtulating with a ſelf-condemned Jew? Thou that da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not take the Lords Supper in thy unhallowed lips; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou take his Prayer? Thou that dareſt not eat This Bread, bicauſe thou art not one bread with thy offending brother; dareſt thou uſe That Prayer, which maketh thy forgiving or not forgiving thy brother, the meſure of Gods forgiving or not forgiving thee? Thou that feareſt to bring
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59001:110"/> an unclean heart to God's Table, dareſt thou bring the ſame to his Throne? Thou that feareſt to be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, dareſt thou make thy ſelf ſo of His Majeſty and Purity?</p>
               <p>Are not Theſe as much contemned by unworthineſs in Prayer, as Thoſe by unworthineſs in Communicating? Is our Lord Man only? is he not God alſo? Is he God of the Sacrament only? is he not of Prayer alſo? Is preparation therefor neceſſary for That only? is it not equally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for This?</p>
               <p>This were enogh. But it is further conſiderabl, that the caſe is very unequal on both ſides. For whereas unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is more objected in bar to the Lords Supper; the Scripture hath ſpoken much more againſt it, in relation to Prayer.</p>
               <p>For we ſhall hereafter find a more proper occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv, that the Apoſtl here reproveth not the unworthineſs of the Perſon, but only of the Performance. Upbraideth not the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with any other ſins, but only ſuch as are committed againſt the Lords Supper it ſelf, and in the manner of its celebration. Doth not ſay, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is turned into ſin, if the Communicant be guilty of Other ſins. But <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 15.8. ſaith expreſly, <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is ſin:</hi> and again, <hi>chap.</hi> 21.27. <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination. David, Pſal.</hi> 50. expoſtulateth in God's name, that they preſume <hi>to tread his courts, and take his name into their mouths:</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. deſcribeth God ſick of his own Ordinances, bicauſe unworthy perſons celebrated them. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeak the ſame language.</p>
               <p>So that if we take our meſures from Scripture, we find much greater reaſon to examin our ſelvs; and upon ſenſ of our perſonal unworthineſs to forbear Prayer, than the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Whence then this ſo groſs partiality? Why ſhould we take That unworthineſs as a Prohibition from This duty,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59001:110"/> which we think not one from the other?</p>
               <p>Were the truth duly conſidered, it would appear that the difference lieth not in the greater or leſs ſacredneſs of the Duties, but our own greater or leſs Sens of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
               <p>It is not Reverence, but want of Appetite; not Fear ſo much, as want of Love, that keepeth us at diſtance, Pretendedly Reverential, and Really Neglective. Why do we not els uſe either the ſame Reverence, or the ſame Boldneſs toward Both? Both equally require Worthineſs, and Both equally require Performance: with This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that in the One we remember the Lord, in the Other our Selvs, But in Both we rob God of his due, thogh in ſeveral kinds. In the Lords Supper we own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and There we deny Frequency; In Prayer we own Frequency, and there we deny Preparation: ſo the One we Perform unworthily, and the Other we Forbear unworthily, and <hi>wipe our mouths, and ſay, we have do'n no wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Say not I plead now for Irreverence in the Communion, or Forbearance of Prayer: No! Religion is not to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with our Corruptions, but to Deſtroy them: will no more connive at Unworthineſs in Prayer, for fear leſt Gods Throne be as much Deſerted as his Table; than at Unfrequency in Communicating, for fear leſt Irreverence ſhould be as rude with his Table as his Foot-ſtool: There is no neceſſity that we periſh either by Poiſon, or Starving, By <hi>[DO THIS]</hi> we ar not Invited only, but Commanded ſo to Honor our Lord, as to Feſt our own Souls.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> The Apostle hath prevented ſuch a conſequence, by ſaying, our Lord appointed us to do this 'till he com. <hi>II.</hi> The ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate meſure of our doing this, is not Eating, but Meeting in the Church. As change of the ceremony hindereth not Perjury from being a ſin, Nor doth change of the ſeaſon hinder us from ſtiling it a Supper. <hi>III.</hi> The Church care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve the memory and title of Feſting. <hi>IV.</hi> The Apoſtl's argument holdeth by <hi>verſ. 20.</hi> more for the Thing than for the Manner, wherein we cannot now be guilty as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were. <hi>V.</hi> The Equitable and Moral ſens of the Argument, accommodate to the preſent manner of Church-meetings. <hi>VI.</hi> Diſtinguiſh between yielding and juſtifying.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT there is yet another way. Obligations without either Countermand or Diſpenſation from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, may fall by the ſinking of the Ground they ar bilt upon.</p>
               <p>Upon the death of our Parents we ar no longer obliged to honor their Perſons, but only their Memories: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, all that we have ſaid ſeemeth to free us from any other duty towards This Inſtitution, but that of ſpeaking and thinking honorably of it.</p>
               <p>For if This be bilt upon a Feſtival Tradition, then will the Apoſtl's declaration of our Lords will, oblige Us to do This, <hi>as often as</hi> They did That: His argument muſt be good againſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and All other Churches that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59001:111"/> might irreverently Feſt in the Church: But when the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> baniſhed Feſting thence, they ſent This Sacrament into the Same baniſhment with it: This we cannot deny (ſince the Apoſtl hath ſo declared it) an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabl Adjunct to That, but ſtill an Adjunct, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for muſt accompany its Subject, whether in Life or Death: We muſt do This as often, but only as often, as we do That, which Now we never do.</p>
               <p>This Objection deſerveth our Anſwer, not ſo much for its dangeroſneſs, as for the occaſion it miniſtereth, for a more clear ſtating our duty, in accommodation to ſo great a change.</p>
               <p>And to cut off at one blow all its power, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Apoſtl hath prevented it by an expreſs clauſ added to <hi>verſ</hi> 26. which ſhews This not to be Mortal as ar our Parents; we muſt <hi>ſhew forth his death</hi> (not only <hi>while Feſting continueth</hi> an Eccleſiaſtical exerciſe, but) <hi>till he come.</hi> Whereby he putteth it out of the Churches reach, in point of Duration, as before he had do'n, in point of Conſtancy.</p>
               <p>He had proved it to be our Lords Conſtitution, not to be omitted in any of their Church Feſts, bicauſe They muſt do This, as often as they drank That Grace-cup.</p>
               <p>And that this humor might not fall upon another part, he further tells them, That thogh they ſhould omit the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace-cup it ſelf; yea, thoſe very Feſts which it muſt attend, or what ever other way they ſhould invent; All muſt be unable to free them from the Immortal obligation, which they had as litl power to Aboliſh as to Intermit: ſince it muſt equal the World in Duration, as well as their Feſts in Conſtancy.</p>
               <p>This therefor, though a poſitive Law, is no leſs Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſibl than a Moral; and the Church hath as much power to Diſpenſ with the Law againſt Murther, as with This, whether by ſapping the Foundation, or battering it with a Contrary doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59001:112"/>II. EITHER therefor That Council which forbad Feſting in the Church was Heretical, and then fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages muſt reſtore it by <hi>poſtliminium;</hi> or elſe the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate foundation of this duty, was not Eating but Meeting in the Church.</p>
               <p>And that This later is the caſe, we have the Apoſtl's clear Intimation (at leaſt) if not his expreſs Declaration. For however at That time, their Feſtings wer as frequent as their Meetings; and on the other ſide, their Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors were not in the manner of their Meeting, but in That of their Feſting; yet his in thrice repeated charge, he doth not lay his accuſation againſt Theſe, but againſt Thoſe, eſpecially <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>When ye com together in one place, it is not to eat the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which words (eſpecially if helped with the now mentioned clauſe of <hi>ver.</hi> 26.) it plainly appeareth, that it Then was, and Ever muſt be the duty of All Chriſtian Churches, to celebrate the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> when ever they meet in his Houſe: Otherwiſe, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> muſt be unjuſtly arraigned as Criminal, having broken no Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>God forbad Perjury, in This ſtile [<hi>Thou ſhalt not take</hi> (in the Hebrew it is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lift up) the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</hi>] The Phraſe is bilt upon their then Cuſtom, of <hi>lifting up the hand</hi> in the name of God. Our form of Swearing is not by <hi>lifting up the hand</hi> above the head, but perhaps by <hi>bowing down the head</hi> to the hand: yet no man pretends the power of the Law aboliſhed with the Ceremony it ſeemeth bilt upon; ſince the Obligation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, not upon the variable Circumſtance of Swearing, but the indiſpenſibl Connexion between our Oath and Truth.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo it is here, This Inſtitution relates to Feſting, as That Law did to lifting up the hand. This requireth that our <hi>Lords Supper</hi> ſhould accompany All our Church-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59001:112"/> as That doth, that Truth ſhould accompany All our Oaths; and the Church may be as Innocent, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation as Firm after the One alteration in the manner, as after the Other.</p>
               <p>And 'tis worth our obſervation, with what temper ſhe hath ever proceeded, that in the Great Changes ſhe found Neceſſary to make, the Sacrament might not loſe its right.</p>
               <p>It ſeems not an Accidental, but Subſtantial circumſtance, That This ſhould be Inſtituted In and After Supper; and conſequently, that it ſhould be Celebrated in the ſame Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, neceſſary both to anſwer its Title [the <hi>Supper of the Lord</hi>] and the Tradition whence it was taken: Yet to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate it before day, appeareth by the unqueſtionable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Pliny,</hi> to have be'n the practice in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>But That Perſecution which Neceſſitated, did thereby Juſtifie ſo Great a variation.</p>
               <p>They wer denyed the uſe of their Public Churches, if they had Any; their malicios enemies watched all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to <hi>mingle their blood with their Sacrifices:</hi> Either therefor they muſt do this before day, or not at all.</p>
               <p>This was a great Change, but no Robbery: for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament loſt not ſo much as its Name by it, but ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be caled the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That change the Emperors Perſecution made neceſſary; and a worſe Perſecution made a Greater one no leſs ſo. The unbridled luxury of the people turned it from the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> to a <hi>Fest of Bacchus;</hi> and it ſeemed impoſſibl to reſcu it from that wors Metamorphoſis, but by turning it from a Deſert after Supper, to a Break-faſt in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="3">III. AND thogh this ſeemed a Greater change than the Former, as taking away not only the Seaſon of the Supper, but the very Nature of a Feſt, yet was the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59001:113"/> Church careful to ſave the Inſtitution harmleſs.</p>
               <p>The Day, firſt conſecrate to This office, ſtill enjoyeth the title of <hi>The Lords day,</hi> and of a Feſt. Four Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils declared it heretical to Faſt, and many Canons forbad to Kneel upon That day; it is honored with a Preparatory Vigil, and a Communion-Service; and every Other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day (if they be not expreſly conſecrate to Feſting) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſame honor and title of Feſtivals.</p>
               <p>And why (I pray' now) why all this care? Why ſo great a Soloeciſm to <hi>Faſt upon our Lords day?</hi> Was he indeed (as the Scribes and Phariſees charactered him) <hi>a riotos perſon, and a Wine-bibber?</hi> If He were, yet certainly St. <hi>Michael</hi> and all Angels ar not, nor wer All the Saints ſo. <hi>John the Baptiſt came neither eating nor drinking.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in <hi>faſtings often;</hi> and many other Saints are honored for their very Abſtinence. How can it be congruos, that the Angels ſhould delight in That, whereof they are by Nature Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable; or the Saints in that, which by Grace they Shunned?</p>
               <p>But granting this, Why then muſt their Eves be Faſting-days? What ſtrange meetings of Contradictions are theſe? That they who in their lives loved and practiced Faſting, ſhould after their deaths delight in Feſting; and yet their very Feſting-days be honored by a Faſting Uſher?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe This be only a Preparative, To what purpoſe ſuch a bedel? Muſt we Therefor Faſt upon the Eve, that we may have the better ſtomach to the following Feſt?</p>
               <p>There muſt queſtionleſs be ſom Better reaſon; and what Better can there be, than what we ar now obſerving; <hi>viz.</hi> the conſtant Practice of All mankind, and particularly of Chriſtians, celebrating the worſhip of God with Feſting; not abrogated, but thus improved, that the <hi>Supper of our Lord</hi> might be it ſelf a Spiritual Feſt, attended with a Corporal one, and uſhered with a <hi>Vigil;</hi> the One proper for its genuine Celebration, the Other for our Preparation to it.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59001:113"/>
               <p>Nor, hath the Apoſtls argument ſuffered more by this change than our <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> the only difference is this, That before, it concluded by Enthymem, and now by Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm.</p>
               <p>While the cuſtom continued of <hi>Eating this bread and drinking this cup</hi> in Every Meeting; the concluſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado followed, <hi>Ergo, He that eateth this bread and drinketh this cup unworthily, is guilty.</hi> But now it requireth the aſſiſtance of an <hi>Aſſumtion,</hi> which Then was, &amp; the Apoſtl ſuppoſed would Ever be ſelf-evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>as often as they met together, they ate this bread and drank this cup.</hi> And thogh the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe</hi> ſeemeth to have loſt its force, bicauſe we do not <hi>eat that bread and drink that cup,</hi> as the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> then did; yet the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ſtill retaineth its ſtrength; and we ar guilty of the ſame charge, of ſo coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as not to eat the Lords Supper, thogh we are not to be convicted by the ſame medium.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. AND if any Clauſ in the Apoſtls whole Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation teach us, That charge muſt needs do it. None of the reſt can teach us point blank, but only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and by Analogy with thoſe ſenſual Debaucheries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which they were leveled.</p>
               <p>It can not now be ſaid, <hi>[one is hungry and another is drunken]</hi> nor can any other of thoſe Characters fit us, by which the Apoſtl deſcribeth the profaneneſs he impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>But we think our ſelfs obliged by Analogy to infer, that as their Senſual unworthineſs made them guilty, where they abuſed a Senſual Feſt, ſo any Spiritual unworthineſs will make Us ſo, if by it we profane a Spiritual one; and for this Analogical reaſon we muſt examin our ſelfs, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this ſeem obliging in point of Worthineſs, much more muſt it be ſo in the Performance it ſelf, For he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth for That, not only by Analogy, but Point blank.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59001:114"/> We find no Reproof, becauſe no Mention, of any but Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual or Schiſmatical unworthineſs in the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> but Expreſs, and thrice Repeted inculcation of their Meetings, as diſhonoring the Lords Supper by their neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</p>
               <p>Either therefor we ar quite out of the reach of his Threats, bicauſe we are free from the Character he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; or if we ar Not, then are we moſt expoſed to That now mentioned, bent againſt their <hi>So Coming together as not to eat the Lords Supper;</hi> ſince That, and only That, can literally be charged upon us:</p>
               <p>And ſince his Cautionary precepts were alſo levelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sin Reproved, they muſt needs ſtrike more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon That Omiſſion wherein we are equally gilty, than upon the Unworthineſs wherein we cannot be ſo.</p>
               <p>And that inſeparabl connexion between the Churches meetings and the Lords Supper, which he ſo induſtrioſly proveth, muſt needs concern us more than any ſuch kind of unworthineſs as he mentioneth Not, ſince That is to continu till the end of the World, by our Lords own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and This is not condemned but by Our own Reaſon, in conſequence of the Apoſtls reproving another kind of gilt whereof we are uncapabl.</p>
               <p n="5">V. IF therefor we muſt accommodate the Apoſtls Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the change, ſo as to ſhun the Unworthineſs Not expreſly forbidden; much more muſt we do ſo in the Conſtancy, ſo Expreſly and Induſtrioſly enjoyned. So that our concern muſt needs be this. <hi>As often as the</hi> Corinthians <hi>ate that bread and drank that cup,</hi> which our Lord had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted to repreſent <hi>his body and blood;</hi> ſo often they <hi>ſhewed forth his death:</hi> and therefor whoever did unworthily cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate That, were gilty of profaning This: The connexion between their Meetings and their Feſts, the Apoſtl did not, bicauſe he needed not mention; but That between Them and the Lords Supper, he proved inſeparabl, both as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59001:114"/> to Intermiſſion and Abolition: The former connexion the Church hath changed, the later ſhe may not, in either of its members.</p>
               <p>We ar therefor, and (till the Lord com) ever muſt be, obliged in All our Church meetings, to celebrate the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and That in ſuch manner, as becometh <hi>his body and blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is the Equitabl and Moral ſens of the Apoſtls words, which was ſo Long and Univerſally paid them, by all Ages and Churches, preceding and following the change, as might create a right, even by Preſcription: but on the other ſide, it hath be'n loſt ſo many Ages, that the Contrary Sens pleads Contrary Preſcription.</p>
               <p>It is now no leſs impoſſibl to reduce the people to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, than it was in the time of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council to reduce them to Sobriety; and therefor the Officers of the Church now find it neceſſary to yield to the hardneſs of hearts callos by time.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. BUT here we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between Yielding and Juſtifying; Our Church ſpeaketh not one ſyllabl to Diſpenſ with the ſtricteſt Conſtancy, but on the contrary ſtill recommendeth it, as often as ſhe can, without expoſing her Own Injunctions to the Same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temt, from which ſhe endeavoreth to reſcu our Lords.</p>
               <p>She doth indeed forbid the celebration, <hi>if there be not a competent number to communicate;</hi> bicauſe if the Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt needs be deſerted, it is leſs diſhonorable, that it be ſo Without the Supper than With it: She therefore leaveth it to the Miniſters Diſcretion, how often it ſhall be offered: but ſhe intruſteth their Piety, to exhort the peopl to com as often as poſſibl. She is Both ways careful, that neither the Willing may want a Communion, nor the Unwilling an Exhortation. She therefor complieth with the peopl's Neglect, no otherwiſe than did the equally valiant
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59001:115"/> and indulgent Captain with his Armies cowardize: he Commanded, he Intreated, he Exhorted, he Reproved; but when he could by no means prevail to ſtop their flight, he put himſelf in their head, that they might ſeem rather to Follow their Leader, than Flee their Enemy.</p>
               <p>But as this compliance of the Captain did not juſtify his Diſobedient Troops, ſo neither do the Churches Rubriks juſtify either Miniſters or Peopl, that are wanting to the Conſtancy ſo plainly Urged by the Apoſtl, Practiced by the Beſt ages, and Recommended by her Self.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is this: Since the Church had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor no Intention, to ſlacken the Power either of our Lords Command, or the Apoſtls Argument; we muſt therefor ſtill own them to have the ſame Power now as ever, and muſt accommodate them to our Preſent meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as if they ſtill were Feſtivals, not only in Name or Spiritually (as we acknowlege them ſtill to be) but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and Senſually, as at the time of his Writing they were; and in the Receſs, the Obligation is no leſs indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolubl againſt the teeth of time, and the conſtitutions of Governments, than againſt any evaſions of ſingl perſons.</p>
               <p>But All this, the More it Obligeth, the Leſs it Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeth. It may (perhaps) Compel us to ſubmit to the Duty, but cannot Invite us to Embrace the Favor. And our Lord doth not uſe to Drive us like Beaſts, we know not Why nor Whither: But to <hi>Lead us with the cords of a Man, with bonds of Love,</hi> with ſtrong Reaſon and ſweet Allurements, the <hi>ſavor of his ſweet ointments,</hi> which ſo draw loving ſouls, as to make them not only Follow, but <hi>Run after him.</hi> And This duty above All others, is That way moſt attractive. The Command made Reaſonabl by a good End, and the End made Amiabl by Relation to our Lord's own Perſon: as we now com to ſee in the remaining words, <q>In remembrance of me.</q>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59001:117"/> populi colligavit.</hi> All the multitude of intolerable Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ar reduced to two, the ſmaleſt number poſſibl, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways practiſed as neceſſary in all honorable Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>For as in all ſuch Orders, the Knight is Once publikly Inſtaled, and ever after weareth ſom Badge of his Order; ſo hath our Lord ordained concerning the Members of his Church: By one Sacrament they are admitted, once for All; by the Other, they ever after Appear his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>Of the Former, our Lords conference with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> well underſtood, diſcovereth both the Meaning and the Neceſſity: And well underſtood it cannot be, without a praevios knowledge of the Practice and Doctrine of the Jews in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But whoever knoweth that they receved Proſelytes into Covenant by Baptiſm, and believed that thereby the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſoul was taken away, and a New one put in his place; that in conformity to this Belief, the man was ſaid to be <hi>New-born,</hi> a <hi>New ceature,</hi> a <hi>New man,</hi> &amp;c. and This ſo properly, that he loſt All Relation to his former kinred, ſo as to be thereby free to marry his Mother, Siſter, or Daughter: He who conſidereth this (and only He) ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily underſtandeth the Reaſonableneſs of our Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> convinced that our <hi>Lord was a teacher com'n from God, bicauſe none could do the wonders that He did, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God were with him;</hi> Yet aſhamed to confeſs this open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bicauſe of his Fellow-rulers; makes his addreſs by Night: but This our Lord, in the ſtile familiar to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, telleth him is not ſufficient; for he muſt openly take upon himſelf Baptiſm, the badge of a Diſciple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> not heeding the <hi>Rabinical</hi> ſons of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wonders at the ſtrange and impoſſibl neceſſity of <hi>entering again into the mothers womb;</hi> and our Lord no leſs wonders at his wonder, that being a <hi>maſter in Iſrael,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59001:118"/> not a Precept ſo familiar; and thence taketh occaſion to tell him, that his Diſciples muſt believe much greater Myſteries. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I tell you Earthly things and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> Meaning by Earthly and Heavenly (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> afterward did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. and in ſeveral other places:) by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the Jewiſh, by the Later the Chriſtian Myſteries; whereof he giveth a Specimen in <hi>his coming from Heaven, his returning Thither,</hi> and <hi>his being There,</hi> and his <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion for the ſalvation of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which we mention This for, is to ſhew that our Lord manifeſtly adopted the Jewiſh Tradition of Baptiſm into the Goſpel, making it then a neceſſary badge of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple; as he alſo afterward did, when he returned to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, requiring his Apoſtles to <hi>go and Diſciple all nations, Baptiſing them;</hi> for this reaſon, bicauſe <hi>whoever believeth and is Baptiſed (i. e.</hi> publikely profeſſeth his Diſcipleſhip) <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi> By all which it is apparent, that our Lord appointed this as a Livree, whereby his ſervants muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to own Him for their Maſter, if they ſhould by him be own'd and ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">III. YET is not this the Adaequate, nay nor the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal badge of a Chriſtian, For we receve This but Once, and that without our own conſent. As were we when this Seal was put upon us, ſo was its Impreſſion, when we came to age, we wer at liberty to Own or Reneg it; and whether we do This or That, appears by no other viſibl mark, but only our Receving or Neglecting This more Critical Sacrament, in due ſeaſon appointed by our Lord, as a more Laſting and Alway Viſible cogniſance.</p>
               <p>I ſay our Lord appointed this Other Sacrament <hi>[in Due ſeaſon.]</hi> For had he do'n it ſooner, his Diſciples would have forgotten his Command before they underſtood it (yet could he not forbear to Prophecy of it, ſaying, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath everlaſting life.)</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59001:118"/>
               <p>But ſince his Death muſt needs be underſtood, when he had ſuffered it, even by Thoſe who before knew not what it meant; he therefor took the time when it was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Preſent, as fitteſt for the Inſtitution, which was both to Commemorate it, and Diſtinguiſh his Diſciples by ſuch conſtant Repetitions, whereof Baptiſm was inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are honored with the Noble Order of the Garter, as they are ſolenly Inſtalled, ſo ar they Obliged ever after to wear the <hi>George</hi> and the <hi>Star,</hi> as permanent badges of the Honor and Vow they have receved; and if Any perſon, however ſolenly Inſtalled, ſhall afterward lay his Habit aſide, he doth not only Offend againſt the Law of the Order, but Diſclaim his Intereſt in it, as refuſing to be eſteemed a Brother of that Royal Fraternity.</p>
               <p>This Sacrament is our <hi>George</hi> and our <hi>Star;</hi> This, if we conſtantly wear not, we tacitly renounce our Chriſtianity. Thoſe very Perſons, who perhaps will not Admit (certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do not ſufficiently Preſs) this for a Neceſſary Duty; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly urge it to other purpoſes.</p>
               <p>When they are required to aſſign the marks of a true Church, they name <hi>Adminiſtration of the Sacraments</hi> for One; and it will troubl any reaſonabl man to deny, that if the Adminiſtration be the mark of a True Church, the Reception muſt be ſo of a True Member of the Church.</p>
               <p>And ſom <hi>Ultramarine Churches</hi> have found it neceſſary to declare, as the Council of <hi>Agatha</hi> did of old, that <hi>thoſe who receve not the Sacraments, oght not to be reputed as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> For which cenſure, thogh we have already ſeen Reaſon ſufficient, yet perhaps we may ſee more.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 2. <hi>THOSE Rites whereby One Religion is Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically diſtinguiſhed from Another, however ſlight the Mater may ſeem, ar highly to be eſteemed for That office.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and Uncircumciſion is nothing,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtl, yet was the One mortal in the Old Teſtament, and the Other in the New, and Both upon the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>He that was circumciſed was a debtor unto the whole Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To eat an Apple, or any other Fruit of a Tree, is a ſmall matter; but when the forbearance was made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Specimen of the new made Creatures owning the dominion of the Creator; Then, Eating was condemned, not only as an act of Miſdemeanor, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: and the Smith which thoght it too much that God ſhould be ſo ſevere for an Apple, might be anſwered, that it was not for the Apple, but for the experiment he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gave of his diſowning Gods authority over him.</p>
               <p>And for This reaſon did God make Thoſe offences Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, which had otherwiſe be'n Venial. He that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed; He that kept not the Paſſover; He that brake the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c. That ſoul muſt be cut off from his people;</hi> bicauſe God had ſaid of every one of thoſe (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſlight) performances, <hi>This ſhall be a ſign between Me and You.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This dubl care of God, as well in Negative as Poſitive Ceremonies, taught his peopl to infer, That if a Jew muſt forbear the Rites of Gentiliſm, then muſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile (as for the ſame Reaſon, ſo upon the ſame Penalty) forbear thoſe of Judaiſm: Since the One no leſs than the Other, was neceſſary to the Diſcriminarive, which was the Adaequate vertu of the Law.</p>
               <p>As God therefor made it mortal to the Jew to Neglect ſuch Rites; ſo did the Jews make it to a Gentile to Uſurp them, as thereby robbing them of their proper vertu; ſince by being common to Both, they wer diſabled to diſtinguiſh the One from the Other.</p>
               <p>The Gentile (ſaith the <hi>Gemera Babylonica) which obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>was guilty of death</hi> (How ſo?) <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid,</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded us a Law for an Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59001:119"/> It is an Inheritancs to Us, not to the</hi> Gentile. Yea, their moſt Learned <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith, that <hi>if a</hi> Gentile <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a Sabbath, thogh he mistook the day, yet if he did it with intention to keep the Sabbath, he was guilty of death. They did not indeed inflict death on ſuch offenders, but ſtripes only; yet not without admonition, that he was guilty of death, thogh not puniſhed with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefor our Lord left us This Law, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did His Ceremonial <hi>[for an Inheritance]</hi> the Reaſon being the Same in the Law, the Crime muſt be the Same in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</p>
               <p n="5">V. THE Same in its Reaſon, but incomparably Greater in Haynoſneſs; For by how much the Covenant is Better, the Law-giver Greater, the Redemtion more coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by ſo much more criminal muſt it be, to omit This, than any <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rite. And how much That is, if we enquire, we muſt do it in the ſtile of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> not to ſeek ſatisfaction, but to expreſs amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law, died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes: of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath do'n deſpight to the Spirit of Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant, that This dreadful Thunder is not leveled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neglect of This Inſtitution, as ſuch; but againſt total Apoſtacy from Chriſtianity: yet if we carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin, we ſhall find the Reaſon, yea the very Phraſe, reach the former. For if we reduce the Rhetorical expreſſions to plain Reaſon, we find the Chriſtian Religion balanced againſt the <hi>Moſaical,</hi> and advanced above it in a triple op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; the Law-givers, the Rites, and the Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>In the firſt, both parties are expreſſed, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>the Son of</hi> God. In the other two, One is expreſſed and the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59001:120"/> Other implyed. 2. The Blood of the Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Chriſtian is Sanctified, implicitely compared with the Blood of the Heifer, wherewith a Jew was ſprinkled. 3. The Spirit of Grace, in whoſe mirific power our Savior firſt, and his Apoſtls afterward, proclaimed the Goſpel, and whom to Blaſpheme was unpardonable; weighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Angel that proclaimed the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second is to Us moſt conſiderabl, That whereas our Lord ſtiled <hi>This Cup</hi> the <hi>New Covenant in His Blood,</hi> The Apoſtl pointeth at it in the Proper Phraſe, as That Character whereby a Chriſtian Profeſſor is to be Known <hi>viz. The blood of the Covenant wherein he was ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For he ſpeaketh by <hi>Metonym</hi> of the <hi>Sign</hi> for the <hi>ſignified,</hi> a Figure Elegant, Emphatical, and Common, It is as if one ſhould thus expreſs a <hi>Knight of the Garter,</hi> deſerting his Order: He hath torn off his Ribon, Broken in peices his George, Left off his Starr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every one ſeeth that the Laying aſide theſe ſeveral peices of his Habit, are ſo many Deſcriptions of his Apoſtacy, bicauſ the Wearing of them ar ſo many Cogniſances of a Brother: Since therefor this Supper Hath (I ſhould ſay, Had) the Same Office in the Chriſtian Church, as Thoſe Cogniſances have in That Fraternity; therefor muſt the Deſertion thereof be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expreſſive of an Apoſtate from Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>There is only This (and no diſadvantageos) difference: That This One Singly, ſignifieth as much in a Chriſtian, as Thoſe Severals did Joyntly, either in <hi>Knight</hi> or <hi>Jew.</hi> He that kept not the Sabbath, might retene other ſignes of a Jew; he might be Circumciſed, keep the New Moons, the Paſſover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But at the date of this Epiſtl, <hi>This Cup</hi> was Conſtantly celebrated by Every Chriſtian, in Every Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as an Indiſpenſibl (bicauſe Critical) Rite of public worſhip; ſo that it was the ſame thing to deſert the Lords Table, and his Church.</p>
               <p>God forbid we ſhould not allow for ſo Great a Change,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59001:120"/> (however unjuſtifieabl) in our Publik worſhip; but ſhould charge ſuch as Apoſtates from Chriſt, who perhaps fear leſs to Shed rheir Own Blood in his Service, than to Drink His at his Table: yet were it to be wiſhed that we would better conſider, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s own Child was in great danger to be deſtroyed for want of Circumciſion, and he that <hi>gathered ſticks upon the Sabbath day,</hi> thoght as litl of Apoſtacy from God, as any of us do from Chriſt: Yea, look we upon the words before us: Who wer they that <hi>dyed without mercy as diſpiſing Moſes</hi>'s <hi>law?</hi> Wer they ſuch only as Totally fell from Judaiſm? Wer they not All ſuch as neglected any One of thoſe Rites, that wer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for Capital, bicauſ Diſtinctive?</p>
               <p>When therefor all is conſidered, we can plead nothing but the goodneſs of our Intentions, or the greater goodneſs of Gods grace; if upon the ſame reaſon, we ſhould be caled to account for our omiſſion of This Rite, no leſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and Indiſpenſibl.</p>
               <p>Yea, as we have already ſeen, if the Reaſon be the ſame, the Crime is much greater; not only bicauſe of the Better Law and Law-giver, but bicauſe of the Greater Contemt. There, the Law was deſpiſed; here the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who's blood is the mater of the Law: That was the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> This the Blood of the Son of God: That was deſpiſed; This is troden under foot: and therefor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo Many and ſo Great accounts; of <hi>how much ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhall he be thought worthy</hi> that is guilty of ſo much greater contumely.</p>
               <p>But bicauſe we uſually judge of the Price which the Law-giver puts upon his Law, by the Penalty which he annexeth to it; leſt we be temted to think our Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per not intended in the words we now com from viewing; And its deſerter ſo far from worthy of any ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that indeed he is worthy of None; bicauſe None is threatned by our Lord in his Inſtitution: It is therefor neceſſary that,</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59001:121"/>
               <p>Thirdly we obſerve,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 3. VVITH <hi>What Obligation our Lord hath bound This duty upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ar here fundamentally to conſider the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawgivers. Our Lord declared his <hi>Kingdom not of this world,</hi> and 'tis plain his Puniſhments ar not.</p>
               <p>For thogh the Apoſtl, the more to prevail with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> ſpeak no Leſs, and perhaps More, of Temporal than of Eternal judgments; yet doth he herein rather ſpeak his Own Reaſon, than our Lords Revelation; applying himſelf <hi>ad homines,</hi> to their ſenſual apprehenſions, not to any declared threats of our Lord; who hath not bound his Command upon us by any Chains of Fear, but the much Stronger, and more proper Bonds of Love. And if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet might make it a complaint againſt <hi>Ephraim, I led them with the cords of a man, with bonds of Love, yet they knew not that I healed them;</hi> it muſt not be Diminution, but Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the crime, if we <hi>break Such bonds aſunder, and caſt Such cords from us.</hi> The word uſed by the Prophet is the ſame, whence our Engliſh <hi>[Cable]</hi> ſeemeth derived, and written by the very ſame Letters. But we need not contend with the Tranſlation, For rhoſe <hi>Bonds of Love</hi> ar Both; Cables for Strength, and Cords for Compliance; Silken Cables whoſe Soft, Smooth flexiblneſs, twineth about the heart; and whoſe Strength ſo forceth it, that it cannot ſo much as wiſh, either to Slip or Break the Obligation.</p>
               <p>Theſe ar called <hi>the Cords of a man;</hi> they lay hold on our Humanity, faſten upon our very Nature, prevail on us by force of Reaſon. And they ar the <hi>Bonds of Love;</hi> no leſs ſuitabl to the Nature of the Goſpel, and more particlarly of This Inſtitution, than to Our Own.</p>
               <p>The very Deſign of the Command, is a Thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Death of the Author: and it had be'n moſt incongrous, ro kindle the Spirit of Thankfulneſs with
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59001:121"/> the bluſtering of Threats. <hi>[Do this, or Dy]</hi> may very well ſuit with the Spirit of Bondage; But <hi>[Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my Death]</hi> to an Evangelical Spirit, is much more Potent as well as Proper; than [Do This for fear of Your Own.]</p>
               <p>As our Lord choſe this more Obliging way, ſo hath he Improved it with all ſuch Endearments, as may faſten it moſt Powerfully upon our Affections; that ſo it may not be poſſibl for any deſpiſer to impute his Kindneſs towards Us, to Coldneſs toward his Inſtitution.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. IT endeareth all Former Laws upon their Common account, which well caſt up amounteth to this End Total: They promote Our happineſs, and that in all
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59001:122"/> Kinds and Capacities, Private and Publick, Inward and Outward, Temporal and Eternal. They exalt us above the Troubles, by putting us above the Cares and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this world; make us both Uſeful and Amiable in our generations, Spiritual in our affections, Godlike in our converſation, <hi>Perfect as our heavenly father is perfect,</hi> as much in Happineſs, as Goodneſs: they promote not any other intereſt of God, but his delight in our felicity: And This is a great argument to invite our obedience, twiſted of Intereſt and Gratitude.</p>
               <p>And the bonds of Gratitude which oblige us to obey God for Kindneſs of his Commands ar dubled by That of his Promiſes. He imputeth it as a Service, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Rewards, infinitely greater than the beſt Service could pretend to, if we will accept of the happineſs he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us.</p>
               <p>And what can Love do more? Yes! our Lord hath do'n yet More, Infinitely More for us. He hath not only taken Care, but Paid for our happineſs; and the Price was great as the Love that paid it, and the Obligation thence deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved greater than Both the Other. For his Laws and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhewed the Love indeed, but mingled with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, of a Father. His Power was thereby Governed, but not Weakned: they provide for Our happineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out robbing Him of any part of his own.</p>
               <p>What the Pſalmiſt ſays of his Works, we may apply to his Laws and Promiſes: <hi>He ſpake and it was do'n, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and they were created.</hi>

               <p>No voice therefor of this <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi> caled more loud upon Us to Follow Him, than That whereby he caled upon God as <hi>forſaking him.</hi> Never more a King, than when Crowned with thorns, Anointed with ſweat and bloud, and Enthroned on his Croſs.</p>
               <p>There, There was he exalted on the throne of <hi>Love,</hi> There did he ſtretch out his inviting Arms, There did he open, not his Arms only, but his Heart, who's wide door let out his Bloud, to make room for Us. This doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cal his [Exaltation] <hi>I, when I am exalted, will draw All men unto me.</hi> All Men, of All Humours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, All Nations and Ages.</p>
               <p>The ſtubborneſt metal, that will not be Broken by his <hi>Authority</hi> will be Melted by his <hi>Love;</hi> which cannot be better Kindled or Fueled in our hearts, than by the <hi>wood of the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can That be better ordered, than by This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was appointed for That very End.</p>
               <p>By This he is ſtill <hi>ſet forth Crucified among Us</hi> (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore among the <hi>Galations</hi>) however remote in <hi>time</hi> or <hi>place.</hi> By <hi>this</hi> he is ſtill Exalted to his Croſs. By This doth his Heart ſtill open it ſelf, to ſend forth <hi>freſh bloud;</hi> and his Mouth, to utter <hi>new cries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But oh! thoſe Cryes muſt be New indeed; and to New, but Sad purpoſes. On his Croſs, he cried upward,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59001:123"/> to his ſeemingly deſerting Father, <hi>[My God! my God! why hast thou forſaken me]</hi> But at his Table, he cryeth downward, to his too really deſerting diſciples: <hi>My friends! My friends! why do you forſake me! Is it nothing to You, Oh all you that paſs by? Behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto My ſorrow, which is do'n unto Me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord Once afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger for your ſakes,</hi> and which you ſtill repete by your unkind neglects of the ſalvation I then ſo <hi>dearly purchaſed,</hi> and now ſo <hi>lovingly offer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether his Bloud by ſpeaking more Sweetly, do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpeak more Powerfully, than his Commands, yea, or Promiſes can do; I neither Dare, nor Need to determin. All that I pretend to, I hope is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> That This Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by ſhewing forth his Death, draweth us with a New attractive, and bindeth us with New obligations; to obey ſuch a Lord, ſo purchaſing, and ſo offering ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. 2. THIS doth not only add New Obligations to former Laws, upon their Old account; but is it ſelf a New Law, upon a New account. This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the Cord of a Man, bicauſe it draweth and bindeth us to our Lords humanity. He that ſaid, <hi>[If you Love me keep my Commandments,]</hi> recommendeth them after the ſame proportion, as they have intereſt in his Perſon; to which therefor ſince This hath greateſt Relation, it muſt alſo have greateſt Claim to our Obedience: If you love me, you will keep all my Commandments, bicauſe they are Mine: but This above All, bicauſe it is not only My Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment but My Monument.</p>
               <p>Its Relation is ſo ſingular to our Lords Perſon, that it is Incommunicable even to one part of his Nature.</p>
               <p>In all the Reſt, the whole Trinity is concerned, bicauſe they ſerv the whole Divine Nature. In keeping them we obey the Father alſo, from whom he profeſſeth to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceved them; If we partake his ſpirit, the Holy Ghoſt is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59001:124"/> honored; but Spirits have not Fleſh and Bloud, which in this ar commemorated. By the Reſt, we ſerv God; By this, we honor the Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus; to whoſe Mediating, ſuffering perſon, this ſervice is adaequately Proper.</p>
               <p>All our founders, as they have provided us Maintenance, ſo have they ſuch Statutes, as they thoght moſt conductive to the enjoyment of their bounty, and the ſervice of God's Church: And ſom of them have left us particular ones, for commemoration of their own Perſons: Thoſe we own our ſelves obliged to Obey, but theſe to Embrace; and ar ready to pronounce That man Unworthy the Benefit; who ſhould contemn the Perſon, in ſuch commemorative Statutes of the Benefactor.</p>
               <p>This is the Sole Law of the later kind; In the reſt he ſpeaketh as a Maſter, a Shepherd, a Lawgiver; inſtructeth us in our duty to God, our Neighbour and our Selvs: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one pointeth ſome Other way: This Only pointeth to his Own body, and ſaith, Do this for My ſake; <hi>Do it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Me,</hi> of My Body, My Bloud, My Death: The Death which I was willing to ſuffer for your ſakes, you cannot ſure think unworthy to be remembered for Mine.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER influence this may have upon O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one would think it could not fail to reach Thoſe, who's whole Religion is employed in amoros paſſions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Lords Perſon, no way ſo much, or ſo diſtinctly concerned, as in This duty.</p>
               <p>To cloath our ſelves with His righteouſneſs, to lay hold upon him by Faith, to be married to him by aſſurance, to ſay None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt, He is Mine, and I am His, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like amorevolezzas cannot ſit but with an ill grace, upon ſuch as neglect This office; which himſelf hath appointed, as the Onely one, whereby we celebrate our Love to his Perſon, as a Man, and after the manner of Men, Viſibly, and Solenly.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59001:124"/>III. 2. THIS Sacrament hath not onely the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of our Lord, but the Image too. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon</hi> built himſelf a Pillar, for the ſame reaſon as our Lord inſtituted This Sacrament: That wore <hi>Abſalons</hi> Name, but not his Likeneſs. <hi>Lots</hi> wife became a Pillar of Salt. <hi>i. e.</hi> an everlaſting monument of Gods judgments: We may (for oght I know) innocently believ, as many do, that ſhe was turned to a Statu of Salt; which in ſom ſens might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her Body, thogh it reteined nothing of it, but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions: But This Sacrament is more than either Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Image; It repreſenteth, not only his Body, but his Soul; not only his Death, but his Benefits; nor doth it onely Repreſent, but Exhibit them All.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we now it wer no more but a lifeleſs Statu; Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for no other end, but merely to commemorate his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: The loweſt Conſequence of this loweſt Suppoſition, muſt be This; that all the Honor or Contemt we ſhew it, muſt paſs on, and reach his Perſon.</p>
               <p>Bicauſe the Perſons of the Caeſars wer ſacred, therefor wer their Statues ſo too: not onely Secure from violence, but Securities to ſuch as fled to them from it; and on the contrary, thoſe who maliced the Perſons, ſhewed it to the Images, either by caſting dirt upon them, or (if they could) by caſting them down to the dirt. Whoever prophaneth this Sacrament, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, defileth our Lords Statu with dirt; whoever wilfully neglecteth it, giveth it a pull, toward caſting it to the ground. To forget a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative, or Hide a Repreſentative; is no better than caſting down a Statu; who's whole worth conſiſteth in it's Viſibility.</p>
               <p>Nor can it ever be more conſiderable than now, that the affront to the Perſon riſeth in equality with the Livelineſs of the Statu, and the Care and Coſt imployed in ſetting it up. When ever we ſee a piece exactly artificial; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude both the skill and care of the Artiſt ſuitably great.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59001:125"/> A great Artiſt gave This for the reaſon of his induſtry in Painting, <hi>I paint</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for Eternity.</hi> This is to ſhew fotrh our Lords death <hi>[till he com]</hi> and he was careful it's Perfection ſhould be ſuitabl to it's Office and Duration.</p>
               <p>What is it, dear Soul! what is it that thou wouldeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template in thy beloved? His Paſſion? Behold how the Bread is broken, and the Wine poured out. His Benefits? Behold Bread that ſtrengthens, and Wine that chears the heart. Wouldeſt thou melt in compaſſion? Behold he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth for thee. Wouldeſt thou be raviſhed with Joy and Thankfulneſs? Behold he Feaſts thee. ctc. So Many, and ſo Contrary motions and aſpects, All ſo lively repreſented; proclame the Author to have imployed as great Care, as Art; and as great Affection as either, in making a Piece ſo many ways Perfect.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. BESIDE theſe Intrinſecal endearments, ariſeing from the Beauty and Deſign of the Law it ſelf; we may obſerv our Lords care, to honour it with the moſt advantageos Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Our Apoſtl is very careful to mind us that it was <hi>[the ſame night in which he was betrayed]</hi> and good reaſon had he, ſo to remark this Seaſon; ſince our Lord himſelf expreſſed a wonderful Eſteem for it. <hi>With a Deſire</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>have I deſired to eat This Paſſover with you before I ſuffer.</hi> And why ſuch longing for <hi>[This]</hi> above All other Paſſovers? Even bicauſe it came juſt before he ſuffered. 1. It was the laſt night of his life, And 2. The night wherein he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and foreknew he ſhould be ſo; and conſequently, as it was the Laſt, ſo the Bittereſt of his life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was the <hi>Laſt.</hi> Other Paſſovers Prefigured his death; This both Prefigured and Accompanied it.</p>
               <p>Had he do'n This in any Other Paſſover; he muſt both more Incongruoſly have commanded his Apoſtls, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate what was future and unknown; and leſs Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have recommended what was yet Diſtant; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59001:125"/> the intervening time would have Blotted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand out of their Memory, before the meaning were Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their Underſtandings; which apprehended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his intended death, 'till That laſt night.</p>
               <p>But now his Death being in a manner Preſent, Give That Life to the Law, which it Took from the Author: For the words of dying perſons, Live longeſt, and Reign moſt powerfully, in the ſurvivors affections: Potent, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cary with them all the Powers of departing life; and Venerabl, bicauſe attended with all the Horrors of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death; as coming, not only From the Soul, but With it too: They contract into a point, all the rays of dear affection in the Speaker; and moſt powerfully enflame it in the Hearer: A Truth, more ſenſibly felt by ſuch as have received the Laſt requeſts of departing friends; than can be expreſſed in Any, but ſuch Dying Language.</p>
               <p>I doubt whether All <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s living careſſes, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much Love to his <hi>Livia,</hi> or ſtamped ſo Deep and Laſting impreſſion upon her Memory; as did his dying complement: <hi>Livia conjugii noſtri memor vive &amp; vale.</hi> What Expreſſions and Incentives of dear Affections, did thoſe few ſyllabls, at Such a Seaſon contein? He thereby told her, that he was now to leav Empire, Life, and Her. But it was in Her Power, to preſerv him in a great part of All Three, eſpecially That, which of All was deareſt to him. He had Long made her heart his Throne, and Now deſired to have it for his Monument: he therefor prayed both the Gods and Her, to take care of That life, wherein was preſerved the remains of his Own. To this purpoſe, but infinitely more obligingly, ſpake our dying Lord: not in the language of a faint, but quiet ſickneſs; but in the Agonies of a <hi>tormented Soul;</hi> not in a few Complemental words, ſuddenly offering themſelvs to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s mind, and perhaps as ſuddenly flitting out of <hi>Livia's,</hi> certainly dying with her; but upon a premeditated Deſign, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a laſting Monument; whoſe firm durablneſs ſhould Fix
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59001:126"/> the fugitive impreſſion; and by conſtant returns, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Renew it; ſo to keep his Bloud from Drying up, and his Death from Dying.</p>
               <p>His Laſt Command, oght to be as powerful to work Obedience in his Diſciples; as wer his laſt Cryes, to work Faith in the <hi>Centurion;</hi> ſince Theſe ſhewed no leſs the Strength of his Love, than Thoſe did the Vigor of Life, at the very point of Death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But much more, when we further conſider, that as it was the <hi>Laſt,</hi> ſo was it the moſt <hi>Dreadful night.</hi> This Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover had not onely the ſame <hi>bitter herbs,</hi> with others; but much bitterer Gall. He had the Devil for his gueſt; and he that <hi>dipped with him in the diſh,</hi> was about to Betray him; And he had his mercileſs enemies for his attendants, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſwords and ſtaves to take and deſtroy him. This was <hi>That dreadful night,</hi> wherin his Soul, oppreſſed with horrors, complained, <hi>That it was exceeding heavy, even to the death: The ſame diſmal night,</hi> wherin the ſtabbing ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his tormented mind, made every pore of his body a wound, bleeding great grumos drops, and thoſe ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as to run <hi>down to the ground. The ſame terribl night,</hi> wherin the dreadful proſpect of his approaching ſufferings ſo confounded his faculties; that with dubled and trebled importunities, he prayed to have <hi>That Cup taken from him,</hi> for drinking whereof he came into the World. <hi>The ſame amazing night,</hi> wherin he was ſo near ſinking, that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an aſſiſting Angel, to ſupport him under his burthen. Even in <hi>That moſt hideos night,</hi> did his care of This Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo prevail over All Thoſe Horrors, which prevailed over his faculties; as to bring him to a truce, and he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt to forget, what night it was.</p>
               <p>To Forget? No, but (what was incomparably more) to Long for it, to Deſire it With a Deſire, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſire, with ſuch a deſire, as outvoiced all the cries of his terrifying and tormenting paſſions.</p>
               <p>Could we poſſibly underſtand the load that made him
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59001:126"/> complain <hi>That his Soul was exceeding heavy even unto death;</hi> and how much his Longings for This very ſeaſon, <hi>outweigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> ſo great a load; then poſſibly may we adjuſt the eſteem he had for This his <hi>Dear Inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. BUT if on the other ſide we compare the Affection, wherewith We Receive it (ſhall I ſay?) with that, wherewith we find our Lord Recommended it; we ſhall find <hi>Solomons</hi> words moſt perverſly verified: <hi>As in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter face anſwereth to face, ſo doth the heart of man to man:</hi> For as the Reflex is directly Oppoſite to the Incident; anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Right ſide, with the Left; ſo doth (our Obedience ſhall I ſay, or our Performance? no, but) our Neglect, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer our <hi>Lords Care.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He choſe the <hi>Laſt night</hi> of his Life for the Inſtitution; and many anſwer This, by chuſing the Laſt of theirs, for the Performance; as if appointed to ſhew forth, not <hi>His Death,</hi> but Their own. When they have <hi>receved the Sentence of death in themſelvs,</hi> and ar immediatly to receve That of God; Then firſt do they think fit to receve the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> as a kind of Charm, ſomwhat better than the <hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi> to fright the Devil from ſeiſing his own.</p>
               <p>When the Phyſician hath declared, or other Indications make it apparent, that there is no hope of returning to Thoſe ſins, which Therefor only they repent of, bicauſ they ar Paſt; when the Will is ſealed, wherin they bequeath That ſoul to God, whereof they had ſo long given the Devil poſſeſſion; Then, in commutation for a whole life, ſpent in contemt of This and All other holy exerciſes; the Miniſter is ſent for, ſom good words ſpoken, Abſolution granted, and Sealed with This Sacrament. And now what uncharitabl Infidel can doubt, but that the man is Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in vertu of the One; and receved into Eternal joys, in that of the Other? ſince our Lord himſelf promiſed, that <hi>Whoſoever Eateth his fleſh and Drinketh his bloud hath Eternal
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59001:127"/> life;</hi> or how can This Bread and Wine poſſibly be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ar Any time fuller of Vertu, than when ſo lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceved, that the digeſtive faculty of the ſtomach, hath not at all impaired it?</p>
               <p>BUT others do not Thus put it off to the very Laſt. Many own it, if not a Duty, yet an acceptabl act of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; Laudably, thogh perhaps not Neceſſarily, to be performed in the <hi>mids of life:</hi> Yet even Thoſe, (thogh not in the Same, in Another wretched ſens) make it their Laſt Care.</p>
               <p>When All other Intereſts and Inclinations ar ſerved; Then perhaps ſhall This have it's turn. But if any thing els crave it, however Slight or Trifling it be; This Holy Office muſt yield it Precedence.</p>
               <p>Pretences ſo Slender, that a hundred twiſted together, ſhall not be ſufficient to draw one from a Goſſiping, or any other Meeting; ſhall ſingl be abl to draw him from the Lords Table: With <hi>Solomons</hi> yawning Sluggard he cryes there is <hi>a Lion in the way, a Lion in the ſtreets;</hi> when indeed he fears no danger But to his Luſt or Eaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I had buſineſs</hi> ſays one. But (pray Sir) what was That Buſineſs? Was it greater than what our Lord had, in That <hi>laſt</hi> horrid Night, wherein he forced all his dreadful crouds of <hi>griefs</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> to give way to This Care? Was it ſo Importunate, that it could not be Neglected? or ſo Urgent, that it could not be Delayed? or ſo Suden, that it could not be Prevented? Didſt thou uſe all indevors, to Keep or Diſpatch it out of the way? Did it Surpriſe thee juſt in the nick, when thou wert going to the Church; and upon the very ſpot Diſable thee from performing thy then fixed reſolution? Didſt thou Wreſtle againſt it with thy utmoſt Strength, and yield to it no otherwiſe, than as to an Invincibl Neceſſity?</p>
               <p>If ſo, thou art <hi>ſo far</hi> excuſabl. For Neceſſity hath This only of good nature, that it Defends thoſe moſt, who have moſt Reſiſted it. But if thou haſt either Wilfully
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59001:127"/> Draw'n this pretended hindrance upon thy ſelf, or Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly Suffered it to ſurpriſe thee, or Tamely Yielded to it, or be'n <hi>any way</hi> Defective in ſtriving againſt it; look <hi>how many grains</hi> the Hindrance falleth ſhort of Inſuperabl, and thy Endevors of Perfect; <hi>ſo many</hi> doth thy Excuſe, of Juſtifiable.</p>
               <p>BUT, the buſineſs which is too Slight, may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Innocent: And if it condemn when put into the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit ſcale; what will it do in the Criminal! Many plead their very Negligence, in excuſe for their Diſobedience; as if they wer therefor Not Guilty, bicauſ they ar Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſo.</p>
               <p>I was <hi>unprepared ſaith he.</hi> And I eaſily believ it, For None duly Prepared will be Abſent. He had not Examined Himſelf. I know That too. For he that hath do'n ſo, muſt find that Omiſſion of a duty, is a Crime. I may add, he hath not Examined his Obligation; for had he do'n ſo, he muſt have found, that the Same Apoſtl, from who's miſtaken words he deriveth his excuſe; ſpeaketh Imperatively to Both alike: <hi>Let a man Examin himſelf, and ſo let him Eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Go to the next Seſſions thou trifler. Go, and There learn if any Offender be quitted, upon pleading himſelf Therefor <hi>not guilty</hi> of the crime he is endited for, bicauſ That was the conſequent of Another: See if a Thief be quitted, if he plead, he ſtole bicauſ he was <hi>Covetos:</hi> or a Murderer, if he plead he killed bicauſ he was <hi>Malicios:</hi> Or a Rebel, if he plead, he Rebelled becauſ <hi>Ambitios.</hi> But if neither Theſe, nor any Other Malefactors, be quitted for pleading One crime in juſtification of Another; then know, that for the ſame reaſon, thou canſt not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, by pleading Unpreparedneſs in excuſe for <hi>Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> ſince That is a breach of as poſitive a Law as This.</p>
               <p>BUT <hi>Unpreparedneſs,</hi> thogh it cannot Wholely Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify, may in Part Excuſe it ſelf. It is but a Singl omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath broken No Other Law, but this One. There ar,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59001:128"/> who go higher; and plead the Greateſt Guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charity</hi> is the Greateſt Command in the <hi>Moral;</hi> and if poſſibl, yet More highly enjoined in the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Law. That, is as much a Moral mark of a <hi>Diſcipl;</hi> as This is a Ritual one. For he that ſaid <hi>Do this in remembrance of Me,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>By This ſhall all men know that you ar my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſom ar ſo impudent, as to plead their very <hi>Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs,</hi> in barr of This Duty; as if they wer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore innocent, bicauſ they caſt off Both their badges; that they may not make One, give the Ly to the Other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am not in Charity ſaith One,</hi> and to this Another add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>I never will be.</hi> Theſe ar indeed Unworthy to com to the Lords Table, but ſo they ar to be caled by his Name. I wonder not, that Such ſhould be afraid to <hi>Eat This Bread and Drink This Cup;</hi> but I wonder, that they dare Eat, or Drink, or Sleep, <hi>at all;</hi> much more that they dare Pray in our Lords Name; and moſt of all, that they dare do it in his Words.</p>
               <p>For he that ſaith, <hi>Forgive me as I forgive;</hi> while he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth to Forgive, needeth no other Guilt, nor no other Sentence, to exclude him, not only from This, but from the <hi>Eternal Supper of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Under Theſe Three heads com the general Excuſes which ar pleaded as hindrances from Performing, what Nothing could hinder our Lord from Commanding.

               <p>For it is irrational to ſay, He valued <hi>it ſo high,</hi> as to think it worthy his Greateſt Care; and yet left it <hi>ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered</hi> with difficulties, that it muſt Rarely, if Ever, be celebrated:</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefor who object ſuch Hindrances, as muſt Freqently, if not Conſtantly occurr, and ar as hardly to be Overcom'd, as Avoided; muſt needs caſt a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh upon That <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs;</hi> that ſhould provide ſuch a Coſtly Feſt, uſe ſuch care to <hi>ſharpen our Appetites,</hi> bid us with ſuch earneſt importunities; yet lay ſuch barrs in the way, that we may <hi>not Taſt it.</hi>

               <p>Theſe and ſuch as Theſe ar the pleas of the Scrupulos, wherein they differ no more from the Irreligios, than the Coward doth from the Sluggard.

               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:59001:129"/>
               <p>Thoſe who plead the Former, condemn Themſelves, as not having do'n their endevor; and Theſe who plead the Latter, accuſe our <hi>Lord,</hi> as requiring what no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors can make Poſſibl. And both the One and the Other may find their ſentence in Thoſe Difficulties, which our <hi>Lord</hi> therefor thoght Seaſonabl for his Inſtitution; that Thereby we might underſtand, he would not admit Any, for Excuſes from his ſo highly favored ſervice.</p>
               <p>HOW unhappily now doth the Image out do its office! How doth our <hi>Lord</hi> ſuffer more in This Repreſentative, than he did in his Body! By their agreement in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Perſon, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were made friends: But the Profane and the Scrupulos, thogh they jointly neglect the Sacrament, cannot be ſaid to Agree, ſince their mutual Oppoſition is not thereby Abated, but En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <p>What ſtrange Antipathy is there in our Nature, more againſt This, than any Other of our <hi>Lords</hi> Commands! that Both extremes meet, not onely in Practiſing, but in Juſtifying Diſobedience to it; and That, upon pretence of honor to the Author! And what luck hath This One Error, that it ſhould be countenanced with (the livree of Truth) the Concurrent aſſent of Oppoſit parties! Were the caſe put in Other names, how plain would the truth appear, to the firſt glance of the unprejudiced ey!</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that <hi>Tib. Graichus,</hi> finding two Serpents in his chamber, conſulted the Sooth-ſayers, and being by them told, <hi>that if he let the male eſcape<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his wife muſt dy; if the female eſcape, himſelf muſt dy;</hi> let go the female, ſo to preſerv his Wives Life with his Own Death.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we now he had employed great care and coſt, in procuring an excellent Picture, moſt lively ſetting forth his ſo great kindneſs; and had on his death-bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to his <hi>Cornelia,</hi> praying her to keep it, as a token and remembrancer of his love, manifeſted by his voluntary death for her ſake.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59001:130"/>
               <p>What would gratitude have obliged Her to do? to caſt it into ſom by-corner out of ſight? ſuffer it to be ſullied with duſt? or buried under lumber, neglected and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? Would it not have obliged her to hang it in her chief room, where ſhe might beſt honor it, not only with her care to keep it from abuſe, but with her frequent looks, ſtill thereby renewing upon her heart, the contemplation of the great <hi>love</hi> of her dear <hi>Gracchus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No one certainly can doubt, which of theſe two ways, beſt ſavor of Love and Gratitude.</p>
               <p>How then can we pretend to honor our <hi>Lord,</hi> when we anſwer his ſo great care, in providing and recommending This ſo excellent a Repreſentative of his death; by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary care in ſeeking pretences to lay it aſide?</p>
               <p>We read (indeed) that ſom heathen worſhiped <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> by caſting ſtones at his image; and ſom others wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped <hi>Pehor</hi> by turning their back-parts to it.</p>
               <p>Strange expreſſions of honor and worſhip, and contrary to the univerſal ways of mankind! Yet not ſo contrary to nature, as Our way of honoring the Sacrament, is to the expreſs words of its author; who doth not onely impoſe the duty, by a peremtory Command to Do this; but bind it upon our hearts, by the obligations of Love and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in Remembrance of his Sufferings and Benefits.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Serviceable to our own intereſts.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>

A brief Recapitulation of what hath be'n here ſaid, with a Tranſition to what remains.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THAT this appropriation to our Lords <hi>perſon,</hi> may not more Prejudice than Advantage This <hi>Law;</hi> as impoſing upon us a duty, Serviceabl to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to Us both Troubleſom and Unprofitabl; we ſhall farther conſider, that in This, as much as in Any of his Other <hi>Laws;</hi> he was careful to twiſt our Intereſt with our Duty; providing no leſs for Our Eaſe and Happineſs, than for his Own Memory.</p>
               <p>We therefor com now to Another kind of Obligations, derived from the Kindneſs of This Command; which again pointeth at the ſo conſiderabl [THIS.] And firſt let us ſee how EASY it's yoke is.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59001:131"/>
               <p>For what is This, whereby we ar So <hi>to ſet forth</hi> his cruel Death, that thereby it may be ſaid our <hi>Lord is crucified among us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Muſt we Pledge him in <hi>his Bitter cup,</hi> and ſo <hi>Do,</hi> as to Suffer <hi>in remembrance of him,</hi> what may in ſom kind make us <hi>Partakers of his paſſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Muſt we ſo Commemorate his Scourging as to Repete it upon our ſelvs, yet call the ſeaſon <hi>Good-Friday?</hi> Or muſt our Purſes be drained in ſom ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oftly Offerings, as ſhall That way repreſent the effuſion of his whole ſtock of bloud? Or at leaſt, muſt our eyes be afflicted, and thereby our Bowels tormented, with ſom ſuch piteos ſpectacle, as may at once repreſent the gaſtly countenance of our dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior, and ſtrike horror into our hearts?</p>
               <p>No: <hi>Our Lord</hi> was careful to deliver us, not only from the Curſe, but from the Burthen of the <hi>Law;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for ſhunneth whatever might have the leaſt appearance of Coſtly, or Troubleſom; adopting only the Joyful part of <hi>Type.</hi> What was Feſtival, he ſo retaineth, as to leav out the Bitter Herbs, yea, the bitter ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>The Type which prefigured This death, was to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Ey a painful ſight. A poor dumb innocent Lamb ſlain, the body hung up and flayed, with legs ſpread'd juſt in the poſture of a crucifix, the bloud folenly poured out at the foot of the Altar: muſt not the Commemorative exceed the Type? and muſt it not be a more afflictive Spectacle? The Former it doth, but is not the Later.</p>
               <p>For here the very Sacrifice Eſcapes the ſuffering which it Repreſents. The Wheat and the Grape, Repreſent the Benefits, but not the Sufferings: That is broken, and This is bruiſed, but they feel it not; That Strengthens, and This Chears; but Neither of them Afflicts the heart.</p>
               <p>SOME may do well to conſider it better: This is a ſacrificial Feſt, but not a Sacrifice: And between theſe two the Diſtance is ſo wide, that it looks like Oppoſition, ſuch as is between Giving and Receving: Guilt, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59001:131"/> Fear and Joy: All poſtures are inverted.</p>
               <p>In the act of Sacrificeing, the Votary appeared as a <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſupplicant,</hi> confeſſing himſelf <hi>worthy of Death,</hi> and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>vicarios bloud</hi> of his beaſt, might be accepted, and his Own delivered: But in the ſubſequent Feſt, he was treated as a Gueſt and Friend, of his now Reconciled and Propitios God. In the One he appeared as a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, dreading Puniſhment from his offended Judge: In the Other as a Son, enjoying Communion with his Loving Father. In the One, he <hi>Offered a Ranſom;</hi> in the Other, he <hi>Receved a Treat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefor, this Inſtitution anſwers the Later, and ſhuns the Former; it oght to be honored with a ſuitable Name. Since here is No Offering, but All Receving: No Coſts, but All Advantages: No Bloud, but That of the Grape; and That, not now to be Shed, but only Drank; no beaſts ſlain, but thoſe <hi>Wild Luſts,</hi> which prey upon our Souls; nothing of Pain to the Body, or Coſt to the Purs, but all joy and thankfulneſs to the Soul: it is ſo far from deſerving the name of a Sacrifice; that we ſeem to injure it by ſtiling it <hi>Sacrificial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I KNOW not what ſo great ſympathy there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Suffering,</hi> that many voluntarily run upon <hi>This,</hi> to expreſs <hi>That.</hi> Som merely to ſhew forth their Love to their Lord, have waited on him with ſwords hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at belts made of their Own skins, purpoſely ſo flayed from their fleſh, as to fit that office; yet ſtill ſo hanging to it at either end, as to renew the pain every ſtep: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with arrows voluntarily ſtuck into, and ſtill ſticking in their fleſh, &amp;c. When the ponderos Idol is pompoſly carried upon its Scaffold, roling on a multitude of heavy wheels; the devout <hi>Indians</hi> oftentimes caſt themſelvs in the way, there to be cruſhed to death by their beloved God. That many <hi>offered their Sont and Daghters to Devils,</hi> the Scripture both witneſſeth and condemneth; That the <hi>Turks</hi> oftentimes pull out their eyes in devotion to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:59001:132"/> Travellers inform us: What the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do upon <hi>Aſh-wedneſday,</hi> and That which they (notwithſtanding) call <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> is ſufficiently know'n.</p>
               <p>Had our Lotd enjoyned <hi>Som,</hi> or <hi>All this,</hi> in anſwer to his ſuffering, <hi>would</hi> we not, <hi>oght</hi> we not have don' it? Had he required us to <hi>lay down our lives for him,</hi> what had this be'n, but to <hi>pay</hi> what we could of a <hi>debt?</hi> At other times he ſaid, <hi>Go and ſell all thou haſt, and give it to the poor, and take up thy Croſs and follow me: Pull out thy right ey, cut off thy right hand.</hi> But now that he ſaith only <hi>Do this, Eat This, Drink this;</hi> what a vaſt weight of <hi>contempt</hi> muſt <hi>That</hi> be, which ſhall outweigh not only the <hi>Authority,</hi> but the <hi>Love of our Lord,</hi> favoring us with a Commandment ſo <hi>ſweetly obligeing!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did He on his Croſs drink <hi>Gall and Vineger,</hi> made infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more Bitter by my ſins; and ſhall not I at his Tabl drink Wine, made infinitely Sweeter by his bleſſing? Did he <hi>Eat the Bread of Affliction</hi> for My ſake; and ſhall not I eat the <hi>Bread of Life</hi> for His ſake and mine Own? Did He <hi>Suffer</hi> death, and ſhall not I <hi>Enjoy,</hi> by Commemorating it?</p>
               <p>Could any thing <hi>Eaſier</hi> or <hi>Cheaper,</hi> leſs <hi>troublſom</hi> or <hi>coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> have be'n enjoined; ſuch was his kindneſs, that he would have commanded <hi>That;</hi> and if we refuſe <hi>This,</hi> which is the <hi>Least,</hi> it appears we will do <hi>Nothing</hi> for Him. For Him? Yea, for our Selvs. This is not a Work, but a Feſt; which if it be but <hi>Inſipid,</hi> though not <hi>Bitter,</hi> is to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. 2. THIS therefor is conſiderable as the <hi>Second kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of this Inſtitution. It is as <hi>Pleaſant</hi> as <hi>Eaſie;</hi> and if we would ſpeak properly, we muſt not call it a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but an Invitation. For it is a Feſt, yea, it is the Banquet: when men had <hi>Eaten the Fat, and Drunken the Sweet,</hi> and their <hi>hearts were merry;</hi> Then came <hi>This Supper,</hi> as the <hi>Deſert,</hi> furniſhed with the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely delicios,</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:59001:132"/>
               <p>And thogh the abuſes thereof, made it in few ages ſeem neceſſary to change <hi>This proper Seaſon;</hi> yet is not the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and beatifik rite thereby impoveriſhed. Its delights were uſhered with <hi>ſenſual mirth,</hi> rather for <hi>State,</hi> than Need; For it's own <hi>Spiritual pleaſures,</hi> ar abundantly abl to <hi>fill</hi> all our great <hi>appetites,</hi> without <hi>borrowing</hi> any thing of the <hi>ſenſual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the more diſtinct diſcovery of this topik, we will riſe by three ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Spiritual pleaſures are greater than Senſual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Pleaſures of the Chriſtian Religion greater than thoſe of any Other Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Pleaſures of This Office greater than thoſe of any Other Office of Chriſtian worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Spiritual pleaſures are greater than Senſual, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> hath ſufficiently demonſtrated in That beſt of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, whoſe title profeſſeth to prove, <hi>That upon the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of</hi> Epicurus <hi>it is impoſſibl for a man to live happily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among other inſtances of the excellency of the pleaſures of the <hi>Mind</hi> above thoſe of the <hi>Body;</hi> he thus ſpeaketh to our preſent purpoſe, concerning <hi>Sacrificial Feſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Princes and Kings keep good open houſes, and a full Court for all comers, and make publik Feſts: But Thoſe which are made in Sacrifices and Solemnities of the Gods, amids perfumes and incenſes, where men ſeem to touch and convers moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately with them, with all Honor and with all Reverence; ſuch Honors, ſuch Feſts, I ſay, give a joy more rare, and a delight more ſingular, wherein He hath no part, that hath not faith nor confidence in the Divine providence. For it is not the quantity of Wine that is drunk, nor the Cookery of good vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands that ar eaten there, which give the joy in ſuch Feſts; but the aſſurance and perſuaſion, that God is Preſent, Propitios, and Favorabl, and that he accepteth the honor and ſervice there do'n him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> cannot taſt theſe delights, the <hi>Apoſtl</hi> hath given the Reaſon, <hi>The Natural man underſtandeth not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59001:133"/> the things of God, neither can he know them becauſ they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> His Faculty is defective: The Viands want not ſweetneſs, but <hi>His Palate</hi> is vitiated. <hi>He is in the gall of bitterneſs, and therefor hath no part nor lot in This mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is no leſs certain, that to ſuch Palates, the very <hi>Supper of the Lamb</hi> in heaven, would be no leſs <hi>Unſavory.</hi> For how can the <hi>Viſion of God</hi> be beatifical to Him, that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him? What delight can He find in the fellowſhip of the <hi>bleſſed in Heaven,</hi> who finds none in Thoſe who reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them upon earth? What Muſik in heavenly Hallelujahs to Him who finds none in <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs?</hi> Can a Plowman find pleaſur in a Mathematical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration? or a Lion in ſweet graſs? or a Fiſh in cleer Air? <hi>The fruits of the Spirit</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtl) <hi>ar Lov, Joy, Peace,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Symmachus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> pleading that our Sea viands ar more delicios than thoſe of the Land, urgeth This as his main reaſon; that from the Sea we have Salt, which quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth the guſt of All other meats.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It's relation to our Lords Perſon is greater, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it hath a greater ſweetneſs! My <hi>Father's Picture</hi> hath This right to my eſteem, that it giveth me ſome kind of enjoyment of his <hi>Preſence;</hi> And for This only do I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu it, much above what a ſtranger can.

               <p>This is the joy of the Sacrificer (ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) that we have <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that <hi>God is Preſent;</hi> But whereon is This ſo ſweet <hi>Aſſurance</hi> bilt? 'Tis true, <hi>Jus hoſpitii</hi> by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimos conſent of mankind, begat an obligation of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> between <hi>Hoſt and Gueſt;</hi> and upon This common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the rite of Sacrificeing grounded: But Invented, <hi>Plutarch</hi> knew not When, nor by Whom; never Stabliſhed by <hi>Any Command,</hi> nor Encoraged by any <hi>Promiſ of the Gods</hi> they Feſted with; Whereas Here, we find, not only our <hi>Lord's Inſtitution,</hi> but his Preſence.</p>
               <p>He promiſed his preſence, even at our Common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; ſaying, <hi>When two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be in the mids of them:</hi> Here, we meet not only in his Name, but upon his Invitation; In Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59001:135"/> to his Command, and in Love to his Perſon; we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the <hi>Sufferings of his Human Nature,</hi> and we <hi>adore the Power of his Divine;</hi> we enjoy not only his Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, but his very Body and Blood.</p>
               <p>In Sacrificeing ſaid <hi>Plutarch,</hi> we <hi>convers intimately with the Gods. Theſe things,</hi> ſaith <hi>St.</hi> John <hi>we write unto you that your joy may be full; — that you may have fellowſhip with Us, and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> probably in thoſe words compareth, <hi>Our God and Lord,</hi> with Thoſe in whoſe fellowſhip <hi>Plutarch</hi> placed his greateſt joy: We may make another compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Fellowſhips themſelvs;</hi> yea, between the <hi>ſeveral kinds</hi> of fellowſhips, that a Chriſtian may have with his Lord. <hi>Several kinds of fellowſhips?</hi> No, There is no other kind of viſibl <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> but This one: <hi>Other kinds of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> there are; but no other <hi>Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether we com to God with our Praiſes, or our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; whether we com to Hear him, or to call upon him; we keep an awful Diſtance: We Approach his Throne, but do not Sit down in it. It is boldly ſaid by <hi>Plutarch, In Sacrificcing Feſts we even touch the Gods;</hi> a Chriſtian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Higher: We do not Touch only, but Eat; we receve our Lord, not Only in our Arms, but our very Bowels. We Feſt, not only With him, but Upon him: He ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Souls with us, and is no more Two, but One Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>We Feſt upon his Fleſh and Bloud; which himſelf ſaith ar <hi>Meat indeed,</hi> and <hi>Drink indeed;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Here is Fellowſhip indeed;</hi> and what more Need or Can be added to make our Joy Full?</p>
               <p>If therefor there be <hi>any joy in the ſpirit, any comfort of love;</hi> what ever the Voice of <hi>David</hi> could Sing, or his <hi>heart conceve;</hi> whatever the <hi>Light of the Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Wine,</hi> or the <hi>joys of feſting,</hi> can faintly ſhadow; ar Here in the <hi>higheſt perfection,</hi> earth is capabl to enjoy: as
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59001:135"/> much above the pleaſures of Sens, as the Firmament is Brighter than Earth or Sea; and as much above <hi>other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,</hi> even of Devotion; as the Stars ar Brighter then the interſtellary Firmament; whoſe <hi>light</hi> while they Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, they Increaſ: Upon which <hi>later account</hi> alone, we heard <hi>Symnachus</hi> give the Sea preeminence over the Land, as mother of Salt, the <hi>Univerſal Sawce, exalting the Guſt of All meats:</hi> But</p>
               <p n="5">V. 2. SALT doth not ſo much <hi>improve the Guſt</hi> of meats; as doth This Sacrament, the Power and conſequent Pleaſur of other <hi>Religios Offices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. How the power of Preaching is thereby advanced we ſhall find another occaſion to conſider, to which therefor we adjourn it and proceed to other Religios exerciſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Oath, when duly uſed is One kind of <hi>Worſhip of That God,</hi> when we thereby Invoke; an end of All ſtrife, and all ſuſpicions among mankind; And its Obligations at generally ſuppoſed more Indiſſolubl, when Bound with This Sacrament, or taken at the Altar.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and All Chriſtendom with them, agreed in This, that the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty could not be more Inviolably confirmed, than by This Bond. And if it have not proved Security ſufficient; it is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt it's force; but a proof of the invinciblneſs of That Falſhood, that will as litl be Slave to the moſt formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl Oath, as to a Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. HOW great pleaſur there is in PRAYER, we ſhould better underſtand, if we were better acquainted with it. The <hi>Stoiks</hi> believed our Pleaſur to conſiſt in Freedom from Pain: It is plain, that Bodily Pleaſur doth ſo; and the Satisfaction is pleaſant, in exact Proportion with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite which is thereby ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>It is ſom <hi>Eaſe to a wounded ſpirit,</hi> if it can but Bleed out it's troubles, into the boſom of a Faithful friend; but much more, if That friend be as able as willing to help.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:59001:136"/>
               <p>God is indeed of himſelf <hi>more willing to hear than We to pray,</hi> for ſuch bleſſings as conduce to our True Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but in Som Other kinds of Requeſts, (which thogh they com not up to the higheſt dignity, we think worth asking) he is Moved by Prayer; and ſo much the more, when it is Improved by the Manner and Seaſon of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. <hi>Heſter,</hi> the more effectually to prevail with her great <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> endeared her petition with a Feſt: and This, we com now from finding the Sens of mankind, in that univerſal rite of Feſting upon the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Indeed God is to be laid hold on by either hand: Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Feſting, upon occaſions reſpectively ſuitable, exalt the power of Prayer; the one, that we may move Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration; the other, that we may obtain Bounty: by the One we kill the Beaſt; by the Other we hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God.</p>
               <p>If therefor <hi>Hannah</hi> found her grieved mind ſo much eaſed, by having unburthened it in prayer, improved by the holineſs of the place; we muſt have ſo much more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the joys of Hope, by doing it in this exerciſe, as his Table is holier than was <hi>Shiloh.</hi> And if <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> prevailed with <hi>Admetus</hi> by preſenting him his litl Son; how much greater confidence may We have, when we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate by the body and bloud of Chriſt!</p>
               <p>For the young Prince was a perfect ſtranger to <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> came in his way, and thence into his arms, by mere accident, without any thoght of becoming his Mediator: but our Lord <hi>came and dwelt among us,</hi> and <hi>was made ſin for us:</hi> and when we obſecrate <hi>by the myſtery of his Incarnation, by his Croſs and Paſſion, by his precios Death and Burial:</hi> offering them to his Father, not only by Words, but Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch Dramatical Actions, as in a manner Repete them; This do'n by his Own inſtitution, muſt needs add unſpeakabl force to thc Petition ſo preſented.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Admetus</hi>'s child was wholely paſſive, joined not the leaſt token of conſent with <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>'s act, for his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59001:136"/> Body was offered without any concurrence of his Mind: But This Supper is of our Lord's own providing: We therein offer, not only his Body and Bloud, but his Love and his Soul. Himſelf taght us this ſingular art of wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with his Father: and having promiſed that he would grant whatever two or three ſhould agree to ask in his Name, taght us further to invigorate our confidence by adding his Body and Bloud.</p>
               <p>HENCE it is, that in the Primitive Church the Prayers ever were attended with This Sacrament, as we found them deſcribed by <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> upbraiding the <hi>Donatists</hi> for breaking down the altars of Churches, told them that <hi>thereby they did what they could to hinder the Churches prayers,</hi> for <hi>illac ad aures dei aſcende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſolebat populi oratio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence is it, that in the <hi>Communion Service,</hi> we again pray for the ſame bleſſings we had prayed for in the firſt: for the Church Vniverſal, the Kings Majeſty, the whole Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor need we any other than our adverſaries teſtimony: The Papiſts in ordinary caſes, think ordinary maſſes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; but in their greateſt extremities, have recourſ to This, as a more powerful mediator than any their <hi>Ora pro nobis</hi>'s, I inſtance in the caſe of the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy;</hi> whom when the incenſed King could by no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion be induced to pardon; a multitude of his friends, after a ſolen Proceſſion, receved the Communion in his behalf; as did alſo the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> in a maſs ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by the Biſhop of <hi>Faviers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, Thoſe very perſons we diſpute with, Thoſe who neglect it all their lives; ar careful in the End to obtain it. When they look death in the face, Then by all means muſt the Miniſter be ſent for, and the neceſſary two or three muſt accompany the Sick perſon, however at that time moſt unfit, to receve the hitherto neglected Supper.</p>
               <p>Whence this new care, but from a perſuaſion, that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59001:137"/> Now more than ever, there is great need of effectual prayer, and that this holy Sacrament is moſt efficacios for inforcing it?</p>
               <p>But have we no need of effectual prayer 'till we com to dy? Need we no Pardon, nor no Bleſſing? Ar our Luſts ſo mortified, our Graces ſo perfect, our Salvation ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, our Happineſs ſo complete? Can we anſwer the kind offers of this Sacrament, as the <hi>Shunamite</hi> did thoſe of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when he asked <hi>what is to be do'n for thee?</hi> Do we ſo live upon our own, as to want No Favor? Or have we No <hi>friend,</hi> No <hi>child,</hi> No <hi>relative,</hi> that needs our prayer? Have we No petition to offer for our King or Country, Our Church or any Comember? Ar all things ſo perfectly well within and without us, that we need no further favor? If we think ſo, we need this Sacrifice to obtein pardon for That very thoght. And certainly the Continuance of ſo uniform and complete happineſs, is a bleſſing worth Deſiring, and therefor worth Asking; and if ſo, the Sacrament is worth Receving; that ſuch Prayers may be more Prevalent, and our Minds more Satisfied, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving depoſited our requeſts in the moſt Succesful manner.</p>
               <p>For if on our Death-bed we find comfort, much more reaſonably may we hope it in the <hi>mids of Life;</hi> as by the more probabl ſoundneſs of our Repentance, ſo by the more efficacios vertu of the Sacrament; receved then with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both Worthineſs and Appetite, than the Death-bed can promiſ; which can naturally operate no better in acts of Spiritual, than of Temporal life; ſo much Leſs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goroſly by how much More againſt all Appetites.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. 4. IF the Pleaſures of <hi>Prayer</hi> be ſo great, thoſe of <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> muſt needs be much greater: For <hi>Prayer</hi> proceedeth from ſens of Want, <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> from ſens of Abundance: That, is the work of the Indigent, This, of the Rich: That is the happineſs of the Earth, drawing down the <hi>former and later rain,</hi> to ſatisfy it's
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59001:137"/> drought; This the bleſſedneſs of <hi>Heaven,</hi> whoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have no other Imployment, nor greater Joy, than to <hi>bleſs God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot perhaps better underſtand the pleaſures of Thankfulneſs than by comparing it with That which of all others, the world thinketh, both moſt Pleaſant and moſt Honorable; Revenge, above all other <hi>Human</hi> (if it be not worſ than <hi>Human</hi>) paſſions, may boſt of the <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions it hath wroght upon the earth,</hi> of Perſons, yea, of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, yea of Nations; and He is branded for a Coward, who will ſpare life Temporal or Eternal, when This ſhall require them for Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> is no other than White Revenge; more Glorios and more Innocent. The One ſaith as doth the Other, I will Requite, <hi>I will do to him as he hath do'n to me, I will render to him according to his work,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And is it not more Noble and Pleaſant to requite Good than Evil? Ar not the ſatisfactions of Love ſweeter than thoſe of Anger?</p>
               <p>Both, glory in Juſtice; but the One, while it pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Do Juſtice, Violateth it; by invading Gods right, who hath ſaid <hi>Vengeance is mine:</hi> The Other more than dubleth the glory of Juſtice, by the addition of <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO THIS ſo excellently pleaſant exerciſe is <hi>this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> deſigned, St. <hi>Paul</hi> caleth this the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing;</hi> The Fathers, <hi>the Euchariſt;</hi> Our own Church ſaith, it was <hi>for a Thankful remembrance of the Death of Chriſt, and of the benefits which we receve thereby,</hi> And requireth Every communicant to receve it with thankfulneſs. And ſince the Pleaſures of <hi>Revenge,</hi> grow in exact ſuitableneſs with the Reſentments of the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> thereby gratified; and the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> with the Injury offered; ſo alſo muſt the Pleaſures of <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> anſwer the Benefit which giveth it birth.</p>
               <p>Whence it muſt neceſſarily follow that as the Benefits Here communicated, ar the Greateſt; ſo muſt This exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59001:138"/> be of All other the Pleaſanteſt; eſpecially bicauſ the very <hi>Paſſion</hi> is hereby moſt vigoroſly excited: which is a dubl advantage.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Benefits hereby commemorated ar the Greateſt. I hope This will not need much proof: Since it cannot be imagined what our <hi>Lord</hi> could have do'n More, than ſuffer the Death we hereby Commemorate. A Benefit, which as it Requireth, ſo doth it Exceed our higheſt raptures of <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi> Excellently well doth our Ingenios and Pios <hi>Herbert</hi> expreſs this.</p>

               <p>But our <hi>Lord himſelf</hi> hath be'n pleaſed to help us, as by his Death againſt our Guilt; ſo by <hi>This Inſtitution,</hi> againſt our Inability to find a way, wherein to expreſs our <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> for That death: When our Beſt wits, and Careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſiderations cannot tell what to do: he biddeth us <hi>Do This.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>David</hi> Propheſied of it, is not ſo plain; as that he was very happy in <hi>So ſpeaking</hi> as if he had: for he pitched upon the ſame Anſwer to the ſame Queſtion, <hi>What
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59001:138"/> ſhall I render</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to the Lord for all the benefits, that he hath do'n unto me? I will take the cup of ſalvation and call upon the name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with This difference; that All the Benefits which ſo poſed <hi>David,</hi> came incomparably ſhort of our <hi>Lord's Paſſion;</hi> and conſequently <hi>This Cup,</hi> as it much better deſerveth the Title, ſo doth it exceed in Pleaſantneſs, That which he ſtileth the <hi>Cup of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By this Cup our Thankfulneſs is moſt vigoroſly incited.</hi> For as No <hi>benefit</hi> can be greater than our <hi>Lords death,</hi> ſo cannot our Affections be more powerfully ſtirred, than by This Repreſentative; which aſſalts our very Senſes, and ſtrikes our Hearts by the moſt Lively Repreſentation, as we have already ſeen.</p>
               <p>Other Feſters pretend no more than to provide Viands and Wine, as delicios as poſſibl; Our Lord takes care that our Palates may be quickened; As he provideth the Beſt Mater for our <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> ſo doth he the Beſt Manner for exalting it's Motions, and Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Such a Commemoration improveth the kindneſs even of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> it ſelf. He ſeemeth to have contrived how he might make the Remembrance of it, as Sweet to Us, as the Suffering was <hi>bitter</hi> to Himſelf. Certainly, ſhewed the ſame Love, in providing for our Joy, by This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; as for our Salvation, by the Effuſion of That Bloud which we ſo Enjoy.</p>
               <p>So that by <hi>Doing This,</hi> we do not only Render Thanks for that Greateſt Benefit, his Death; but Receve a New one; and feed our very <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> which acquireth a New Obligation, and thereby new mater of Pleaſure by endeavoring thus to anſwer the Old: And we may ſtill go on with <hi>Davids</hi> queſtion; <hi>What ſhall I render for this cup of Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By how much therefor the <hi>Joys of Thankfulneſs</hi> exceed All other Joys: By how much our <hi>Lords Paſsion,</hi> more exceedeth our utmoſt Thankfulneſs, than could All Thoſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59001:139"/> other Benefits, which ſo poſed <hi>David;</hi> By how much This Office is more Appropriate and Serviceable to it, than Any, yea than All other offices of devotion: By ſo much More Pleaſant muſt This be, than Any other Exerciſe, even of Religion, yea even of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>And if there be any truth in what St. <hi>Paul</hi> (after the Prophet) profeſſeth, that <hi>ey hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceve, what God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> If there be any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his invitation, to quit the ſatisfying pleaſures of wine, for the more raptures inebriations of the Spirit; we muſt needs believ that our gracios Lord had the ſame deſign in This Inſtitution, as St. <hi>John</hi> profeſſed in his firſt epiſtl, which he uſhereth with this declaration, <hi>Theſe things I write to you, that you may have fellowſhip with us, and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and theſe things we write unto you, that your joy may be full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did <hi>Epicurus</hi> ever promiſ ſuch Happineſs? Did <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi> ever make ſuch a feſt? Did <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi> ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch pleaſures? That any one who hath (I ſay not any ſpark of divine life, but) any ſens or deſire of Pleaſure, ſhould ſlight ſuch invitations, is next to the Love that made them, the greateſt Wonder, and next to That of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the greateſt Injury; ſince this is in a manner to <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame</hi> in Effigie. Do we not put This his repreſentative and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Himſelf, to an open ſhame, when we ſo ſlight it, as to poſtpone it to our more eſteemed luſts and idleneſs, as unable to match them in its offers of happineſs?</p>
               <p n="7">VII. OF HAPPINESS! Yes, it ſerveth not only our Pleaſures, but our ſolid and durabl Happineſs. It is not our Flatterer, but our Friend. Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers often ſerv mens Pleaſures to ill purpoſes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievos conſequences: This doth not more ſeek to Pleaſe, than to Benefit. As it is a Banket to delight, ſo it is both
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59001:139"/> Food to nuriſh, and Medicine to cure. The gracios Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor caleth it <hi>Meat indeed and Drink indeed,</hi> bicauſ the gueſt hath not only preſent ſatisfaction to all his appetites, but <hi>Everlaſting life</hi> to his Soul.</p>
               <p>This, 'thogh moſt worthy, I inſiſt not upon, bicauſ it is not only generally acknowledged for a truth: but by our adverſaries urged as the principal, if not ſole encorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the performance. They honor it as a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios Invitation, thogh they deny it the authority of a Command: and while they unty the force of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, make part of recompence, by motives of perſuaſion, drawen from our own intereſt.</p>
               <p>And no more than need, For it muſt be wholely inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, and totally deſerted, if unfurniſhed of all kind of arguments: and if it have none other but ſuch as plead our own advantages, they had need outweigh all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties we muſt encounter.</p>
               <p>AND Now <hi>(Dear Reader)</hi> we are com'n to the Rode: You cannot fail of good Company and good Guides: Variety of good books, both ſetting forth the Benefits of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and the Preparation requiſite to capacitate us for them; and Many alſo giving us their own good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in Devout Strains helping our devotions. And ſince I promiſed, not to <hi>repete what others have ſpoken;</hi> I ſhall (do, as guides uſe to do) leav you to <hi>Gods bleſsing</hi> and the Conduct of others, into whoſe company I have broght you, in a large and populos rode.</p>
               <p>But Before we part, we may do well to ſit down a while, and conſider whether the way we have paſſed, be as Right, as we have found it Troublſom. It hath be'n ſo Long, and ſo Univerſally deſerted, ſo utterly Untroden for ſo many generations, that there is not any appearance of a Footſtep, much leſs of a Path: This is ſufficient to make us Doubtful.</p>
               <p>But if the Learned and Pios be not only Silent, but Oppoſite: If they not only neglect to Urge the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59001:140"/> as Neceſſary; but warn us from it as Dangeros; it will certainly behove us to hearken to Such Perſons, and conſider their Admonitions, and their Reaſons.</p>
               <p>After a brief Retroſpect therefor upon the grounds we have paſſed, we ſhall take a full vieu of what is offered on the Other Side; that ſo, weighing the rival evidences, we may embrace what ſhall appear worthy.</p>
               <p>WE have certainly taken the only Regular way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Apoſtl's meaning: not cut off ſome One, or perhaps Two expreſſions, neglecting All the Reſt, and the mind of the Author in the Whole; but carefully examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, firſt the adaequate deſign of the Whole, and then every Part and Paricl, with their Conſent in ſerviceablneſs to it. We have found it abſolutely neceſſary ro fit the important Demonſtrative THIS with its proper Object: both bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ in our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> it is the Subject of a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, not otherwiſe to be underſtood; and bicauſ in the <hi>Apoſtls Diſſertation,</hi> it is the hinge on which his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument turns. We have found a Pios cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> very Fit for this honor, and exactly Suited both to our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtl's Comment,</hi> in every ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labl. In the Later, (I mean the Apoſtl's Comment) we have met ſeveral <hi>odd phoenomena,</hi> highly worthy our Beſt obſervation, but never honored with Any; No Other way accountabl; but <hi>this way</hi> moſt Clear, Pertinent, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. We have found <hi>This ſame Apoſtl,</hi> in the Chapter immediately forgoing, cal the <hi>Lords Cup</hi> by the <hi>Jewiſh name;</hi> expreſly ſaying This is the ſame with That.</p>
               <p>By this Light we have taken a careful vieu of <hi>That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant clauſe,</hi> whence is vulgarly derived a ſuppoſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do this As Seldom as we pleaſe; and found that the Apoſtl was careful to inſert Thoſe words, upon a quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reaſon;</hi> proving it indiſpenſibly required, that we do it <hi>as often as we meet in Chriſts publik worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From This diſcourſ of One Apoſtl, we proceed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the practice of All the Reſt; and found Them
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59001:140"/> and <hi>All their Diſciples,</hi> and the ſucceeding <hi>beſt ages of the Church;</hi> exerciſing Punctual Obedience to ſuch a ſens. We have found our Own Church laboring what ſhe can, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the ſame.</p>
               <p>From Obligations of <hi>Obedience,</hi> we proceeded to <hi>the cords of a man.</hi> Reaſon we find requireth, that the Badge of our profeſſion ſhould be conſtantly worn: and Kindneſs obligeth us to embrace an office, ſo Endeared as we find This, by all incentivs of Love.</p>
               <p>In the whole journy we have not found the leaſt Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence or Impertinence of any One ſyllabl: but every Word, and every Order, yea every Diſorder of words, combine to declare This the true Key to <hi>Our Lords</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtls meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I may Boldly Challenge any one of a differing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to match This ſo punctual Diſſection, with any other that may ſuit his own <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> with equal exactneſs: but whether they make the leaſt pretence to it or no, will clearly appear by the examination of what they pretend the Apoſtl to have ſaid to the contrary.</p>

Concerning the Pios, Learned Perſons whom I am to oppoſe, thogh Truth will not permit us to embrace their Errors, Juſtice will require us to excuſe them, bicauſe they Yielded to the then preſent Neceſſity, at a time when there was no appearance of danger on the other hand.</p>
               <p>When a City is Inacceſibl on the One ſide, and Aſſalted on the Other; the defendants think themſelvs concerned to leav That ſide which ſeemeth ſafe; and run to This, which needeth their help; and thogh many an (otherwiſe) impregnabl place, have This way be'n loſt; yet ſtill have the inhabitants be'n rather <hi>pitied as unfortunate,</hi> than <hi>blamed as unfaithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Antient Fathers</hi> ſaw No danger of loſeing <hi>Gonſtancy</hi> in this duty, but Much of loſeing <hi>Reverence;</hi> and ar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for to be Juſtified, bicauſe they applied their labors to what appeared moſt Neceſſary.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Later Fathers</hi> broght That into Queſtion, which their predeceſſors thoght above Any. <hi>Constancy</hi> firſt was ballanced againſt <hi>Reverence,</hi> and then made to Yield to it. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> firſt put the queſtion, <hi>Whether it wer better to Communicate every day, or omit ſom days, that we might do it better upon ſom Others?</hi> This queſtion when it firſt appeared in the World, was no <hi>bigger than a mans hand,</hi> thogh now it have overſpread the whole face of the sky; It grew from <hi>days</hi> to <hi>weeks,</hi> from <hi>weeks</hi> to <hi>month's:</hi> and the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> claims thanks for having made it neceſſary <hi>Once in a Year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This abuſe was ſo groſs, that the Reformers could not but correct: but they did it with ſuch aw both toward the <hi>Later Fathers,</hi> and toward the <hi>Sacrament</hi> it ſelf, that they ſeem to have be'n more careful to ſpeak what they thoght Beſt than what they thoght Trueſt.</p>
               <p>To preſerv the <hi>Sacrament</hi> from being ſwallowed up by the incorrigibl luxury of Their times; the <hi>Fathers</hi> by way of neceſſary defence, aſſerted the <hi>Reverence</hi> due to it, as the <hi>Body and Bloud of Chriſt:</hi> and our <hi>Pios divines</hi> endevor to

               <p>Sure enough, our Lord can not but be well pleaſed, that <hi>This Repreſentative</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi> ſhould ſecond it, in That great and good deſign, for which he <hi>ſuffered it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thogh therefor they ſaw nothing in <hi>Scripture,</hi> nothing in <hi>Tradition,</hi> yet ſeeing in Reaſon great <hi>hopes of advantage;</hi> they thoght beſt to lay hold on an <hi>expreſſion or two</hi> of the Apoſtl's, which (however otherwiſe intended) might be made of excellent uſe This way.</p>
               <p>He had ſpoken of the Danger of Unworthineſs, and the neceſſity of <hi>Self-examination</hi> for avoiding that danger: <hi>Theſe two</hi> well twiſted together, and well bound on, may be of excellent uſe, to draw men to <hi>repentance,</hi> ſo much the more <hi>ſpeedy,</hi> by how much <hi>neerer</hi> the time appears of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the dread Table.</p>
               <p>And how can this be better do'n, than by perſuading men, that no man is fit to Communicate, who is not fit to dye?</p>
               <p>What injury to the Apoſtl, if uſeful words be not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> to his <hi>Particular intention</hi> in that <hi>One place;</hi> but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a greater ſerviceablneſs to the <hi>General deſign</hi> of <hi>All his Labors?</hi> or what to the Sacrament, if it be ſo Reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Danger, as to be made Victorios, not only over <hi>That Intemperance</hi> which it ſuffered at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but <hi>all other</hi> Sins of what kind ſo ever? Or what to our Lord, if the <hi>Repreſentative of his Death,</hi> be made to promote the good ends for which he <hi>ſuffered</hi> it?</p>
               <p>This could not ſeem more Rational, than Safe; The <hi>Commands of the Church</hi> made it <hi>Criminal, Univerſal Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> made it <hi>Scandalous,</hi> to fail of appearing at the holy Table, at <hi>leaſt three times in the year;</hi> and in all appearance the <hi>condicions</hi> of Preparation might be ſtrained to <hi>Any height,</hi> with as great Safety, as Rigor.</p>

               <p>Our <hi>Gratios Lord</hi> juſtified <hi>Moſes</hi> for compliance with the <hi>hardneſs of the peopl's hearts</hi> in a caſe which <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not ſo.</hi> The <hi>Pios Fathers</hi> in former ages, had caſt Feſting out of the Church, thogh <hi>This Supper</hi> wer by our <hi>Lords Inſtitution</hi> appendant to it; and they had removed the Seaſon from Evening to Morning, thogh the very title of Supper contradicted: And why ſhould not ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Advantages on one ſide, yoked with ſuch Security from any Damage, on the other; make it reaſonabl, to preſs Preparation in ſuch manner, that thoſe who wer not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on with Other reaſons, might be awakened by the approach of the Sacrament, to betake themſelvs to <hi>That work,</hi> which otherwiſe they would delay, till the approach of death.</p>
               <p>When therefor we read what was written <hi>twenty or more years ſince;</hi> when the Church had not yet loſt her Power, nor the Peopl their Shame; when neither <hi>Atheiſm</hi> nor <hi>Schiſm</hi> had taught it needleſs to Obey our Lords laſt command; when that neglect was thoght Incredibl which we now find incurabl; let us conſider as well the Reaſons, as the Words of thoſe pios Authors; and we ſhall not think any thing more probabl than This, that wer they now aliv, they would change their Stile with the ſo changed <hi>ſtate of the Queſtion;</hi> and Correct or Confute whatever they have ſaid in abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Obligation to Conſtancy in the performance.</p>
               <p>For proof hereof I give you the words of the excellent Perſon, whom I have ſo often created as an adverſary.— <hi>To ſuch perſons as theſe</hi> (he ſpeaks of Neuters in Religion, not ſo bad as to deſerv Excommunication, nor ſo pios as to be diſcernably in the ſtate of grace) <hi>I can give no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but that every one take his meſures of frequency by the Laws of his Church; and add what he pleaſe to his numbers by the advice of a Spiritual guide; who may conſider, whether his penitent by his conjugation of preparatory actions, and heaps of holy duties, at that time uſually conjoined, do or is likely to receve any Spiritual progreſs.</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expreſsly declared, <hi>This I ſpeak, not that you may abſent your ſelvs, but that you may com worthily:</hi> And we may well believ the ſame to have be'n the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of All our pios divines; wer there No Other reaſon for it but This, That otherwiſe <hi>Their Own</hi> injunctions muſt be as inſignificant as our Lord's.</p>
               <p>For if it be not neceſſary for us to <hi>Receve the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> neither will it be ſo, to Prepare our ſelvs in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they preſcribe in Order to it: And then, all thoſe Cautions againſt Unworthineſs, and Directions for Self-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59001:144"/> may be ſerviceabl (perhaps) to other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; They may be uſeful <hi>to try the truth of our Repentance,</hi> when upon other reaſons we may ſet our ſelvs to that work, but 'till then, may well be laid aſide, notwithſtanding <hi>any obligations</hi> deriveabl from <hi>This Inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefor <hi>All obligations,</hi> but ſuch as ar bound upon us by <hi>our Lord and his Apoſtl,</hi> ar too weak; ſince contrary to <hi>All Expectation,</hi> as much as <hi>All Law,</hi> we have ſeen this <hi>greateſt office of the Church, ſequeſtred,</hi> but <hi>not reſtored</hi> with it's Officers; Since the declared intentions of our pios Predeceſſors, ar ſo groſsly, not onely Diſappointed, but Inverted; that it is generally thoght as much more Safe, as more Eaſie, to Forbear the whole, than to venture upon ſuch difficulties and Dangers, as ly in the way to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; we may very well believ them ſo far from fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs toward their <hi>formerly Hopeful,</hi> but <hi>now Unhappy</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that they would be as forward as any of our <hi>preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> to contribute to the remedy which the <hi>preſent ſtate of the Church calls for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. 2. MY <hi>ſecund Proteſt</hi> is, That I am ſo far from any deſign to rob the Sacrament of its due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that I have already ſaid ſufficient to ſecure me from any ſuch ſuſpicion; were I not now obliged to ſpeak ſuch things, as look't upon in ſeparation from my task, may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me half a <hi>Corinthian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is the neceſſary conſequence of oppoſing errors: For Truth is uſually ſeated like Vertu, between two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes; whereof whoever oppoſeth the One, muſt ſeem to defend the Other.</p>
               <p>The zeal of ſom Fathers for Aw toward the H. St. is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an implicit denial of our obligation to Conſtancy; and then improved, to a contrary obligation to Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And while I renounce this Later, I may ſeem to break thoſe bonds in ſunder, whoſe Obligations I do not pretend either to Break or Unty; but only ſo far to Slacken,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59001:144"/> that they may not by too <hi>ſtreght binding,</hi> diſable us from performing our neceſſary duty.</p>
               <p>I therefor here invert St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Proteſt. <hi>This I ſpeak, not that you may com <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthily, but that you may com Constantly.</hi> I daſh not One part of the Apoſtl's cautionary precept againſt the Other, to the deſtruction of Both; no, nor put aſunder what he hath joined together. But I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor to ſhew how he hath ſo fitted the One to the Other, that they ar not onely Conſiſtent, but Serviceabl each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For when he yoked <hi>[Let a man examin himſelf]</hi> with <hi>[let him eat &amp;c.]</hi> there was no ſtrife between them; and ſom ages they drew very lovingly and proſperoſly together: But after ages made the former draw croſs, and too hard for the later.</p>
               <p>The Greek Church appointeth a Lent preparatory for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the four Solemn tides, whereon the peopl ar obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Communicate: And ſuch among our ſelvs, as think it a neceſſary duty only upon thoſe three great Feſtivals, which ar attended with their Octaves, ſuppoſe it Uſhered with an Octave of preparation: But the firſt ages, which celebrated it every Sunday and other Holidays, could allow it no more than the 'foregoing Eve.</p>
               <p>I deny not (for it cannot be avoided) that if we conform to them in the One, we muſt alſo do it in the Other: More than every ſuch Eve, the neceſſity of moſt mens affairs will not allow; nor the conſtitutions of our Church be ſatisfied with leſs: Whether this be more agreeable both to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtl's mind, and the honour of the Sacrament it ſelf, than either of the other, we com now to conſider.</p>
               <p>And firſt we muſt ſee what is ſaid on the other ſide.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THAT I may here again keep my ſelf from any ſuſpicion of injuſtice, I give you our worthieſt Adverſares opinion in his Own words.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59001:145"/>
               <p>Firſt; he layeth down This for his foundation. <hi>[No man is fit to Communicate, who is not fit to dy]</hi> And having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon raiſed ſeveral, completeth all with <hi>This coronis.</hi> The ſum of all is This; <hi>He that is not freed from the dominion of ſin: he that is not really a ſubject of the kingdom of grace; he in who's mortal body ſin do's reign, and the Spirit of God do's not reign, muſt at no hand preſent himſelf before the holy Table of the Lord: bicauſ what ever diſpoſitions or alterations he may begin to have in order to pardon and holineſs; he as yet hath neither; but is Gods enemy and therefor cannot receve his holy Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Theſe words, and indeed in the Whole Book, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſon endevored to make, the <hi>Same meſures of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> neceſſary for a Communicant; as in another very <hi>Pios and Learned Treatiſe,</hi> he had proved neceſſary for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And thogh he Expreſs it not; yea, 'thogh he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it not, he muſt Imply ſuch a Faith alſo neceſſary for This <hi>Supper of our Lord,</hi> which every where els he denieth to be ſo, for. That in heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> An Aſſurance that he is in God's favor.</p>
               <p>For ſince upon theſe grounds, no man can Otherwiſe be Aſſured of the Lawfulnes of this action, and <hi>whatever is not ſo of faith is ſin;</hi> the want of ſuch Aſſurance, muſt be as ſtrong a bar againſt the performance, as want of Worthineſs: So, <hi>Thoſe Few</hi> only, <hi>Thoſe very Few,</hi> who ar not only in <hi>Gods favor,</hi> but Above all Doubt of their being ſo, muſt preſume to approach his Table.</p>
               <p>Yea, if we will follow the conduct of the Poſition, as far as it will lead us; we ſhall com to believ it leſs ſinful to Dy in ſuch an eſtate, than to Communicate. Bicauſe Death is Unavoidabl, and however it be damnabl to Live in a ſtate of Impenitency, it is no New ſin to Dy ſo. But here, we ar told that we may <hi>avoid the Lords Table</hi> without ſin; and therefor muſt incur a <hi>Diſtinct guilt</hi> by Coming; and that, not only if we be Really Unworthy, but if we Doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ar ſo or no.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:59001:145"/>
               <p>And what a ſingularity it here! In every other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie the <hi>Rival Poſitions</hi> uſe to oppoſe one another as <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Negative</hi> in the ſame Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Our preſent queſtion is, <hi>Whether our Lords</hi> [Do this] <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a Command?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We might in courſ expect no worſ, than a Denial: And That very Denial too, we might hope ſo Tempered, as to leav. Something Anſwerable in Som ſort, tho not fully E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, to the uſual import of the word. An Encouragement, or Recommendation: an Invitation, or Intimation; Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſom ſavor; as Fit, if not Neceſſary: At worſt, if it do no way Oblige us; if neither Duty, nor Kindneſs bind us; yet at leaſt we ſhould be at <hi>full Liberty</hi> to do it, if we pleaſe.</p>
               <p>But behold! We now find it a Command, but a Negative one. For every one is bound to Forbear it upon Such Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as ſhall lay hold upon the <hi>far greateſt part</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And if a Law be made for the Collective body; then muſt This needs be a Negative one; bicauſ not <hi>one of a thouſand</hi> can eſcape the Prohibition.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, That This Prohibition is but Suppoſitive; and between two ſuch Propoſitions there is no Inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; That it may very well be tru, that <hi>[If we be not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, we muſt not do it]</hi> I confeſs it, nor do I accuſe this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable perſon of Inconſiſtency with Himſelf; but his two Suppoſitive Propoſitions of Conſpiracy againſt our Lords Command. Bicauſ the Former, if it pretend to contein the whole Command, Derogateth from it; and the Later plainly Countermandeth it. That, diſableth it from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligeing Any to <hi>Do this;</hi> And This, maketh it Oblige al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt All men to Forbear it. The One falleth unreaſonably Short of our <hi>Lords Command,</hi> and the Other more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably Contradicts it.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59001:146"/>IV. WE cannot now avoid the rudeneſs to demand a ſight of the Warrant which may authoriſe any one, not onely thus to Limit, but Countermand our Lords Laws. It is an undoubted rule, <hi>Ubi lex non diſtinguit, non eſt diſtinguendum.</hi> And Thoſe words which ar accuſed of it, we have ſufficiently cleared from any ſuch Crime. But to Countermand a Law, is much more than to Limit it; and for This, we have not yet ſeen the leaſt Appearance of a Warrant; much leſs, ſo <hi>Clear,</hi> ſo <hi>Imperative,</hi> ſo <hi>Expreſs</hi> an one, as may outvoice both our <hi>Lord and his Apoſtl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Lords Command</hi> is Univerſal <hi>[Drink ye all of this]</hi> This <hi>Apoſtl's injunction</hi> is equivalently indefinite <hi>[Let a man eat this bread &amp;c.]</hi> It is probabl our <hi>Lord admitted,</hi> (certain he Forbad not) <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf: And it is plain the <hi>Apoſtl Prohibited</hi> not, but <hi>Commanded</hi> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, bad thogh they wer. And if Either of them did at any Other time, either Repeal ſuch unlimited Commands, or Prohibit their performance, to <hi>Any kind of Perſons;</hi> when we ſee it, we ſhall ſubmit.</p>
               <p>Yea, (though we have no ſuch Commiſſion) we will take the boldneſs to conform, not only to an <hi>Explicit Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi> peremtorily ſaying, <hi>Do Not this;</hi> but any ſuch word, as by Clear and Neceſſary Conſequence, muſt Infer it.</p>
               <p>If I ſay either our Lord, or This, or any Other Apoſtl, ever drop't a ſyllabl which is capable of being made a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> to forbid not onely the Moſt, but any One member of his Church to do this; thogh I ſhall think it as great a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as Either of them ever wroght; yet I ſhall Admire onely, not Oppoſe the Conviction.</p>
               <p>But there is No ſuch danger, the wonder bloweth from <hi>another point,</hi> even from the ſlightneſs of the Evidences (ſhall I call them) which ar brought againſt the <hi>whole weight</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtl's argument. Two looſ words,</hi> cut off from their fellow members, and miſerably rack't, that they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59001:146"/> may confeſs ſomething againſt His or our Lords deſigne; a few precarios Allegories, and ſom ſhews of Probability, that our Lords Supper would be more honored, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice more promoted another way: Theſe are the whole force we ar to contend with, and ſhall do it in the order now ſet down, beginning with, that which alone is worth regarding, Scripture.</p>
               <p>And here I deny not the truth of the Suppoſition; if the <hi>Apoſtl</hi> hath ſaid any thing which by <hi>neceſſary inference</hi> will forbid any one to <hi>Do this;</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid in expreſs terms, <hi>[Do it not]</hi> But then the Inference muſt be Unavoidabl; and the ſaying whereon it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Uncapabl of any ſuch ſenſ, as may Comply with That Command, which it ſhall pretend to Weaken.</p>
               <p>If once more we look upon the <hi>Apoſtl's diſſertation,</hi> we ſhall find it to conſiſt of <hi>Two main limbs, Poſitions</hi> and <hi>Deductions,</hi> which Depending upon Theſe Poſitions, muſt by no means Contradict them.</p>
               <p>The Poſitions (we have found) aim all at This, That <hi>Our Lord hath ſo inſeparably inlayed His Supper upon all Church-meetings; that, as we May not; ſo, if we would, we Cannot part them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Inferences ar Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. From Conſtancy in the One, he inferreth Conſtancy in the Other. Bicauſ in All your meetings you <hi>eat This Bread, and drink This Cup,</hi> therefor in All your meetings you <hi>ſhew forth the Lords death</hi> by them. This Conſequence we have all this while be'n proving to be his aim.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Other Conſequence</hi> argueth back again, from the Reverence due to our <hi>Lords Perſon,</hi> to Anſwerabl Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to his Repreſentatives. Bicauſ the <hi>Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood</hi> ar concerned in it, therefor you muſt not <hi>eat This bread and drink This cup <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthily.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59001:147"/>
               <p>And this he preſſeth by two important inferences; the Former ſetting forth the Crime in the 27 <hi>verſ.</hi> The Later preſcribing the Remedy in the 28. Upon theſe two, turn all the Interpretative Prohibitions, which muſt revers our Lords Command to DO this, and all his own forgoing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument inforceing it.</p>
               <p>For by the Former All Unworthy perſons ar <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicated; and by the Later every one is bound therefor to examin himſelf, that if he find himſelf unworthy he may execute the ſentence.</p>
               <p>It muſt therefor needs be worth our Labor ſerioſly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the true import of thoſe two conſiderable words; which I ſhall do in their Order.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Former is ſet forth in <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>He that eateth This Bread, and drinketh This Cup UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTHILY, is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi> And again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>He that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth [unworthily] eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi> In the 27. is declared the <hi>Guilt,</hi> in the 29. the <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> And Both of them incurred by doing this UNWORTHILY.</p>
               <p>Our main buſineſs therefor muſt be to meſur the import of the word <hi>[Unworthy]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt we muſt view it, in it's Singl Interpretation, and then in its Aſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's Singl import may be conſidered in Grammar and in Logik.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Grammar we ar to conſider, the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:59001:148"/>1. The Root is <hi>[Worthy]</hi> which Rigidly importeth an Equality of worth; but in a Milder ſens, is ſatisfied with ſom Proportion, thogh ſhort of <hi>Full value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Chancery of the Goſpel</hi> abateth much of what Strict Law requireth; Is ſatisfied with Suitablneſs, for Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This Allowance doth it perpetually give All ſuch words as import Righteouſneſs: And with This Latitude, doth our Apoſtl frequently uſe This very word. E. G. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For if any one think he can in a Proper ſens, <hi>Walk Worthy of the Goſpel, Worthy of the Lord, or Worthy of God;</hi> That very thoght will make him Unworthy, of the mercy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>That Lord,</hi> in <hi>That Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Termination ſpeaketh it an Adverb, qualifying the <hi>Manner of the Action;</hi> Not an Adjective, ſubjected in the Agent: It is not He that eateth and drinketh, being <hi>[Unworthy]</hi> but he that doth it <hi>[Unworthily]</hi> however his Perſon be qualified.</p>
               <p>The Difference between Theſe two, is ſo Wide, ſo Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and (in This place) ſo Important; that it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eſcape ſuch acute eys, as ſom of our adverſaries enjoy, were they not muffled with that Proverbial partiality, which maketh <hi>None ſo blind, as him that will not ſee.</hi> For the firſt ſight of it will expoſe the impertinence (as to This perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance) of all thoſe Schemes and Directories for Self-Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which are ſo carefully ſet forth; as if it wer the ſame thing, to do this in a <hi>Manner</hi> worthy of the Office, and to make one's Self Worthy to be the Officer: This can never be too carefully obſerved.</p>
               <p>I again inſiſt upon it, that This Difference between UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTHY and UNWORTHILY duely conſidered, will let in ſuch light, as will abundantly diſcover, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great flaws in That hypotheſis, to which ſo many good and wiſe men have ſo enſlaved themſelvs, that they ar ſomtimes (as we ſhall anon ſee a pitiful exampl) forced to offer violence to their ingenuity.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:59001:148"/>2. In <hi>Logik,</hi> it is a <hi>Relative;</hi> wherein beſide the now conſidered Relation and Subject, is alſo conſiderabl, the <hi>Correlate,</hi> which is the Party concerned in the Worthineſs or Unworthineſs of the Action. And this is Generally, Groſsly, and Unhappily miſtaken for our <hi>Lords Perſon;</hi> whereas we have ſufficiently proved it to be <hi>[This Bread, and This Cup.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bicauſe ſo much depends upon it, I again deſire is may be conſidered, that the Apoſtl reproveth the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> juſt as a ſober perſon would a rude Bully, if he ſhould ſee him abuſe a Juſtice of Peace, in execution of his Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sir <hi>(might he ſay)</hi> Take heed what you do; you ſeem to take this Gentleman for your Equal, or (perhaps) your Inferior; but then are you miſtaken; for This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, This plain Gentlman, what ever you think of him, repreſents the Kings perſon; And therefor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes you offer Him, ar not private incivilities to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſon, but Publik Miſdemeanors, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſuch an Admonition, Nothing is intended to be urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but what needs it; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Character of the Officer;</hi> which once known, the <hi>Nature of the Crime,</hi> and the Kings concern immediately appears.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE Nature of the Crime; but it's Degree is not ſo plain: The Apoſtl in This place, by a moſt unuſual ſtile, leaveth it to our Own Reaſons to judge. <hi>He is guilty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> but whether of <hi>Trampling it under foot,</hi> or only of <hi>Contemning</hi> it, or in what degree of Affronting it; the ſtrange <hi>Ellipſis</hi> hath left uncertain.</p>
               <p>This is very Certain, and no leſs Conſiderabl; That the affront which paſſeth through the Officers perſon, loſeth much of it's force There; and cannot ſtrike ſo ſtrong upon the Kings, as if it were Directly and Immediately aimed at him.</p>
               <p>The Character doth indeed dignify the Otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderabl
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59001:149"/> Perſon; But the Perſon hath it's Reaction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Character. We make great allowances for the Meanneſs of the One, even when we pay our Honor to the Other. For we think not the ſame Aw due to the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Worſhip, as to the King's Majeſty; nor do we judge the Crime Equally great, in the affront offered him.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Crime had be'n much aggravated, ſo had the <hi>Apoſtl's</hi> own Argument be'n much ſtrengthened; if he had not made <hi>This Bread This Cup,</hi> but our <hi>Lords body and bloud</hi> the proper object of the abuſe.</p>
               <p>Had therefor This Bread be'n the Proper Body, and this Cup the Proper Bloud of our Lord; he was now obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both to Declare and Urge it. In a caſe ſo urgent, an Omiſſion is equivalent to a <hi>Negative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was his buſineſs ſo to ſet forth the Dignity of This abuſed <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cup;</hi> that by Proportion with it, their Guilt may be Aggravated. Would <hi>Truth</hi> have Conſented, his Deſign would have Required him, to have raiſed his voice Higher.</p>
               <p>He muſt have ſaid, he that <hi>Eateth this Bread,</hi> and <hi>Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Cup, eateth the body, and drinketh the bloud of the Lord;</hi> and not have com'n off with a Cold, Indefinite El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipſis; which not expreſſing in What Meaſure, maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing plain but this, that it is in a <hi>meaſure much Inferior,</hi> and conſequently his own argument <hi>much Weaker,</hi> than if he had declared them guilty of contemt to the <hi>body and bloud of Chriſt immediatly,</hi> by Uſing Them in ſuch manner, as they did This Bread and This Cup.</p>
               <p>Thoſe indeed who ſtill believ <hi>This Bread and This Cup,</hi> not to be our <hi>Lord's</hi> Repreſentatives but Himſelf; may juſtly fear the Unworthineſs, not only of their Perſons, however carefully Prepared, but of their Worſhip too, however carefully Performed.</p>
               <p>But we, who believ them no other than what the Apoſtl ſtileth them, even Then, when he moſt Studioſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth them to our Reverence; when upon due <hi>Self-examination</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:59001:149"/> we find, how <hi>unworthy</hi> We ar to Receve our <hi>Lords body and bloud;</hi> may check our fears, by conſidering, how Vnworthy <hi>This Bread and This Cup</hi> ar to Repreſent them; not doubting but the ſame goodneſs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſuch honor upon the <hi>unworthy elements;</hi> will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and accept of <hi>Us,</hi> if we receve them in a Manner ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Office, tho not in a <hi>Degree worthy of his own Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me not be miſtaken. I deny not the Reality of <hi>Chriſts preſence</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> When I call <hi>This Bread and Cup Repreſentatives,</hi> I mean not, that our <hi>Lords body and bloud,</hi> ar thereby no otherwiſe Repreſented, than the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is by his Picture; which ar the proper goods of the Poſſeſſor, and may be treated according to his pleaſure; or than a King is by a Stage-player, which only Imitateth, but Shareth not his power: But as the King is by his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who ſo Repreſenteth his Perſon, as to Execute his Authority; with whom he is (tho not Perſonally, yet) Politikly preſent; Ratifying whatever he doth in his <hi>Name and ſtead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This kind of <hi>Real preſence</hi> our Lord himſelf promiſed, not to Affright but Incorage us. <hi>When two or three</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ar gathered together in my name, there am I in the mids of them,</hi> He meant doubtleſs no leſs than a <hi>Real preſence;</hi> which muſt needs be moſt Eminent in Such aſſemblies as ar <hi>gathered together,</hi> not only <hi>in his Name,</hi> but upon his Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; And to make ſuch a Promiſ, an argument to fright men away, is a ſtrange way of honoring the Author.</p>
               <p>From this diſſection of the very words, we find, them fall very ſhort of the force aſcribed to them. They no way barr any man from <hi>Obedience,</hi> for want of Worthineſs; Require not a Legal Worthineſs in the <hi>Perſon coming;</hi> Make not the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> the Object of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs required in the Performance. And upon the whole, make not the guilt of the Unworthy Performance equal to that of Diſobedience; ſince This Directly affronteth our
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59001:150"/> 
                  <hi>Lords Perſon,</hi> in his Command; That, only Indirectly, in his Repreſentative.</p>
               <p n="3">III. VVE have ſaid that the Anatomiſt is not only to vieu the Intrinſic Texture of the part diſſected, but it's Serviceablneſs to the Life: to what therefor we have ſeen of the proper ſens of the word, we ſhall add it's aſpect upon the Apoſtls deſign, which will be a Further Evidence that he meant not ſo much as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed, bicauſe ſuch ſuppoſal of Perſonal worthineſs would have be'n, 1. <hi>very diſhonorabl to our Lord,</hi> 2. <hi>very Deferent from that Meſure, himſelf ſtateth it by; and</hi> 3. <hi>very Unfaithful to the Corinthians, he requireth it of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It wer a <hi>great DISHONOR to our Lord,</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it poſſibl, that any one can be Worthy; yea, or com within any Neerer diſtance than Infinite Unworthineſs. For Worthineſs is Relative; ſignifieth, if not Full <hi>Equality,</hi> yet ſom Proportion; between the <hi>Merit,</hi> and the <hi>Reward;</hi> the <hi>Feſt,</hi> and the <hi>Gueſt:</hi> And, take which of the <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> you pleaſe, you find a Saint reproving the concept.</p>
               <p>To thoſe that fear their Own Unworthineſs, thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth St. <hi>Chriſoſtom,</hi> 
                  <q>Thou ſayest thou art not worthy to Do this; neither art thou worthy to Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> We may go on, neither art thou worthy to Hear; So far art thou from being Worthy to take our <hi>Lords Body,</hi> that thou art not Worthy to take His Name into thy mouth; ſo far from Worthy to injoy <hi>his Bloud,</hi> that thou art not ſo, to injoy the <hi>light of the Sun,</hi> the <hi>fruits of the Earth,</hi> or any of thoſe <hi>ſenſual delights,</hi> which Beaſts may Injoy, but not Abuſe as much as Thou.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, to thoſe who fear <hi>the Greatneſs of the Sacrament,</hi> thus ſpeaketh another Saint, <q>Thou abſtaineſt from the Bleſſed Sacrament bicauſe it is a thing ſo ſacred and formidabl, that thou not thinkeſt thy ſelf worthy of it: well, ſuppoſe That: But I pray', who is worthy? Is an angel
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59001:150"/> worthy enogh? No certainly, if we conſider the greatneſs of the Myſtery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us well conſider theſe two Sayings, and their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonablneſs, and then judge of thoſe ſo frequent phraſes, <hi>A Worthy Communicant, A Worthy Gueſt,</hi> &amp;c. whereby many unwary perſons, ar more Scared, than with any thing derived from the word of <hi>God;</hi> which never taught us either to think ſo Slightly of our <hi>Lords Bloud,</hi> or ſo High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our Selvs, as to believ it poſſibl by any endeavors to becom Worthy of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The vulgar ſens is very <hi>different from that Meſure, the Apostl ſtateth the reproved Unworthineſs by.</hi> He expreſly caleth it a <hi>[not diſcerning the Lords body]</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, putting no difference between <hi>This,</hi> which our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Own Body, and <hi>Common bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Learned <hi>Mede</hi> very well confirmeth the Jewiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that it ſignifieth Separation; We Sanctify what we honor with Diſcrimination; and on the contrary we Profane, what we uſe as Common.</p>
               <p>The heavenly viſion confirmeth this, warning St. <hi>Peter</hi> from an Error in opinion, analogos to this Crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What God hath ſanctified, that call not thou Common;</hi> To call Common, and Unclean, was all one in St. <hi>Peters</hi> ſens; and not to <hi>diſcern the Lords body</hi> from <hi>Common bread,</hi> is all one as to Deſecrate it, in St. <hi>Pauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this he ſo preſſeth upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as dubly to convince them. <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Have ye not houſes to eat and to drink in, or deſpiſe ye the Church of God and ſhame them that have not?</hi> Poſſibly he might urge this, not as Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crime, but as an Evidence of their unexcuſablneſs in the Former.</p>
               <p>They might (perhaps) plead Ignorance in That; but in This they could not: For thogh (poſſibly) they might not underſtand that they were obliged to Diſcern This Bread as the <hi>Lords body;</hi> yet muſt they needs know, they
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59001:151"/> oght to Diſcern the Church as his <hi>Houſ.</hi> If they knew it not to be Sacrilege, to make the <hi>Lords Cup</hi> an inſtrument of drunkenneſs; they could not but know it ſo, to make his <hi>Houſ</hi> a Tavern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With what partiality do ſom</hi> (for ſom others do not) <hi>treat theſe two parts of the Apoſtls reproof? With what Coloſsik ſtrides do they reach both ſides of Superſtition? On one ſide they dread the Lords Supper, for want of worthineſs in Themſelvs; on the other ſide, they fear to own any reverence toward Gods Houſ, for want of worthineſs in It? How do they rob</hi> Peter <hi>and cloath</hi> Paul? <hi>make the Lords Houſ Common, that they may dubly Sanctify his Tabl? And all the while the Apostl makes This the Corinthians crime, that they diſcriminated not the Lords Body from Common Bread; and This, either another Inſtance, or an Evidence of their Profaneneſs, that they diſcriminated not his Church, from their Own houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I may not now inſiſt upon Any other error, than That of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which the Apoſtl ſaith conſiſted in This, That they So uſed our <hi>Lords Body</hi> and his <hi>Houſ,</hi> as if they had Both be'n Common.</p>
               <p>He chargeth them not Here (thogh elſwhere he do) with any Other crime, but ſuch as Directly and Immediately, deſecrate the One and the Other, and that in This very exerciſe: Taketh no notice of their Other habitual vices, confineth his charge to <hi>This performance,</hi> in <hi>This place:</hi> Forbiddeth not to approach either the <hi>Lords Table</hi> or his <hi>Houſ,</hi> bicauſ they ar intemperate at their Own.</p>
               <p>Yea, he So expreſſeth himſelf as if he would even Compound with them, indulge them their Domeſtik de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, provided they would forbear them Here.</p>
               <p>Not that indeed he Juſtifyeth what he elſwhere plainly enogh Condemneth; but to aggravate This incomparably Greater wickedneſs; whereof the Sacrilege ſo Exceedeth, as even to Hide the <hi>Immorality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Glutton</hi> is guilty of the Fleſh of his Beaſt, and the <hi>Drunkard</hi> of the Bloud of the Grape; but the <hi>Unworthy
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59001:151"/> Communicant,</hi> of the <hi>Body and Bloud of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be drunk with Common Wine in a Common Houſ, is to abuſe both Gods Benefits, and ones Own Body; but to Deſecrate the Lords Houſ into a Tavern, and his Bloud into a Cup of Drunkenneſs; to make That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and This the Scene of Leudneſs; is a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not only above Drunkenneſs, but even above Sacrilege it ſelf: As it hath no Match, ſo it hath no Name.</p>
               <p>If therefor you will not divorce your beloved debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if you will needs be eating and drinking intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; yet know your Place; do not heap Sacrilege upon Luſt, make not the <hi>Lords Houſ,</hi> yea his very <hi>Body and Bloud,</hi> Servants to the leudneſs they would Check.</p>
               <p>This is the Utmoſt reach of the Apoſtls reproof. It comprehendeth (indeed) not only the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> but his <hi>whole Houſ</hi> Yet breaketh not open any Private one: Judgeth no Other unworthineſs but of <hi>This Performance;</hi> Requireth a Difference, not between one Communicant and another; but between This, and other Places, and Suppers: and Conſequently Forbiddeth not Any Perſon to Do This, which we have found All indifferently obliged to Do: but forbiddeth Every one to Do It in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as ſhall make <hi>That Common, which our Lord hath Sanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. 3. THE Apoſtl muſt be <hi>mortally unfaithful to his Corinthians,</hi> if upon ſo <hi>urgent an</hi> Occaſion he did not warn them in Terms as Plain, as the Crime (if any) muſt be Great.</p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>[upon ſo Urgent an Occaſion]</hi> for a <hi>moſt Urgent</hi> one it is, Whether we look upon the 1. <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which he profeſſedly endeavoreth to reſcu from Profanation, 2. the <hi>Argument</hi> whereby he laboreth to do it; or 3. the <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom he addreſſeth all.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:59001:152"/>1. He profeſſeth to reſcu the <hi>Lords Tabl</hi> from Profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to That End, to Cloſe it with ſuch a Rail, as ſhall Fence it from abuſe: If therefor he leaves that rail ſo wide, as to Admit Such perſons, as he oght to have <hi>kept out;</hi> he muſt be <hi>dubly</hi> and <hi>inexcuſably unfaithful;</hi> both to the <hi>Lords tabl,</hi> which he ſhall ſo have expoſed to diſhonor; and to <hi>All thoſe ſouls,</hi> which finding no contrary warning, may com to it, with as great Sincerity as Danger.</p>
               <p>If I find this the <hi>Purlieus</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> guilt, that they Diſtinguiſhed not the Lords Body; then may I be ſecure of One of thoſe Two; Either he who diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lords Body, is free from This, how full ſoever he may be of Other Crimes; Or the Apoſtl muſt be More guilty than the moſt Unworthy Communicant; ſince, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to ſhew the True Extent of the Danger, he warned them, not to diſtinguiſh between Perſons, Worthy and Unworthy; but between This and Common Bread.</p>
               <p>Were his words Ambiguos, yet muſt they here cary a ſens uſual; in a caſe ſo Important, he oght to have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, how much they muſt Now ſignify, above what at <hi>All other Times,</hi> and by <hi>All Perſons,</hi> is aſcribed to them, and which can Intend No more but This: That every one is obliged, So to Diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> and his Own; as to ſhun <hi>Thoſe indecencies,</hi> which ar ordinary in Private Houſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt be no leſs unfaithful to his <hi>Own Argument:</hi> bicauſ contrary to all Reaſon, he muſt have neglected to ſtrengthen it with the moſt Conſiderabl and Obvios Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration.</p>
               <p>For if the excluſion of <hi>Unworthy Perſons,</hi> wer as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl to our <hi>Lords Inſtitution;</hi> as the Conſequence would have be'n ſerviceabl to his Own Purpoſe; he Might, and therefor Oght, to have urged it, and ſo put the <hi>holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> at the Greateſt and Safeſt diſtance from profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:59001:152"/>
               <p>For if none muſt com to This Table, who abuſe their Own; it will be out of danger of any Other abuſe, than Deſertion: If none drink <hi>This Cup,</hi> who is ever drunk with Common Wine; it will be ſecure from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Drunkenneſs which it cannot Tolerate; If none Partake This Bread, who break not Their Own to the hungry; there will be no more danger, that any <hi>one ſhall be hungry,</hi> than <hi>that any other ſhall be drunken.</hi> And ſince the Apoſtl was now obliged to ſpeak whatever Truth would permit, we ar reduced to This choice; whether He wer fals to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> his <hi>Own Argument,</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples ſouls?</hi> or whether it be (Not Forbidden to every Unworthy Perſon, but) <hi>enjoined to every</hi> one, thogh as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy as wer the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to <hi>Do this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Perſons to whom this reproof is addreſſed,</hi> wer ſuch as may induce us to believ, that Gods Providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the Apoſtl's Words, to prevent any poſſibility of believing what we now diſpute againſt. For they wer the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> a peopl of all other the moſt Obnoxios, Proverbially Infamos for debaucheries.</p>
               <p>This City vyed with <hi>Sodom,</hi> as for <hi>fulneſs of bread,</hi> ſo for exceſs of Leudneſs, and diſmalneſs of Deſtruction. Yea, ſo ſtrangely <hi>inſeparabl</hi> was Luxury from every thing of <hi>Corinth;</hi> ſo much more incurabl, than that ſtrange Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy of Jewiſh houſes; that the very Burning of the City, did not Purge, but Propagate it.</p>
               <p>The confuſion of Metals, melted by the raging flames from her multitude of rich Statues, made That famos mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which by the luxurios <hi>Romans,</hi> was preferred above Gold it ſelf, as a more precios mater for their drinking cups; and to be Supremely Luxurios, ſomething of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> muſt contribute: Yet was not Leudneſs conveyed away with her Metals, nor the Leproſy deſtroyed with her Houſes; when it had infected <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, it ſtill ſtuck to the very Site of the place. For when the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageos

               <p>Look we no further than This Epiſtl; we find the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle endeavors to write as Obligingly as poſſibl; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to take notice of more ſins in Them, than in any Other peopl.</p>
               <p>Look we no furthar than This Diſſertation; we find ſuch Supremacy of Prophaneneſs, as may well be Yoked with their otherwiſe matchleſs Fornication; Both of them <hi>ſuch, as ar not named among the Gentiles,</hi> not to be found, but at <hi>Corinth</hi> only.</p>
               <p>This ſo Debauched peopl how doth the Apoſtl Reprove? How doth he Warn them from the <hi>Lords table?</hi> Now, ſure, if ever muſt the ſentence of Excommunication thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Now muſt the Apoſtl plainly tell them, that unleſs they leave their Riot, their Factions, their Fornication, and All Other their Carnalities; they ar not <hi>Worthy,</hi> and therefor may not Preſume, to taſt of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But behold! the either Negligent or Ignorant Apoſtl, droppeth not a ſyllabl of all this <hi>Unworthineſs;</hi> Urgeth No other Prophaneneſs, but what terminated in This Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as it's Proper object.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we now ſay? Were the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſuch Worthy Communicants, as partook no leſs the Lord's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than His Supper? Yea, were <hi>Thoſe very Perſons,</hi> Worthy to receve it, who receved it ſo Unworthily? Or was the Apoſtl ſo Careful, to deſcribe their Crime, and to aſſert the Dignity of the profaned <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and yet ſo Negligent, as not to allow the leaſt Mention, or ſo much as <hi>intimation,</hi> of what was ſo Neceſſary for the due Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Both? but on the contrary ſo Bold, as to Urge them to com, when ſo many muſt by ſo doing, becom Guilty of the crime he reproveth?</p>
               <p>Where now? Where? Where ar thoſe clear Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that plain Counte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Why doth the Apoſtl take ſuch Cold notice of their Notorios Domeſtik Leudneſs as if he ſeemed to Approve it?

               <p>For if in That the Apoſtl did not warn the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from Doing This by reaſon of the Unworthineſs of their Perſons; but only from doing it in a <hi>Manner <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> Then, in This, wherein <hi>Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is preſcribed as a Remedy, he doth not Therefor require us to <hi>Examin our ſelvs,</hi> that we may Forbear if we find our <hi>Selvs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy:</hi> But Therefor, that duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within our conſiderations the dignity of <hi>This Bread and This Cup;</hi> which at That Time did, and at All Times oght to attend upon <hi>All Church Meetings;</hi> we may There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in behave our Selfs with Reverence ſuitabl.</p>
               <p>So that ſtrictly ſpeaking, our Self-examination is not to work Backward upon what we have do'n, that ſo we may know whether we be worthy or no; but Forward upon what we ar now to do.</p>
               <p>Yet bicauſe the <hi>Gramatical</hi> ſens of the word <hi>[Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mans ſelf]</hi> ſeemeth to import More; and it's <hi>Utmoſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59001:154"/> importance</hi> is bound upon us with all poſſibl Rigor; That we may leav Nothing unanſwered, let us hear how This is urged, as an implicit Prohibition from the Duty who's Dignity it is to ſecure.</p>
               <p>And here according to my wont, I ſhall give you the very words of the moſt Excellent adverſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To what purpoſe is it, but in caſe he find himſelf unfit, to abstain and forbear to com. For if he comes UNWOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY, he dies for it: and therefor to examin, muſt ſignify, Let a man examin himſelf ſo, that he be approved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It's worth both our Obſervation and Pity, how hard this worthy perſon is put to it, to bend the Apoſtl's Words to a compliance with his Own Opinion, and at laſt to Break a ſtubborn one, that will not be Flexibl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[UNWORTHILY]</hi> is turned to <hi>[UNWORTHY]</hi> The Former was utterly Unſerviceabl, it muſt therefor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be changed, that with it the ſtate of the Danger, and it's Remedy, <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole affair, may be Changed alſo.</p>
               <p>This Sole conſideration is enogh to ruine the whole ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure; ſo that we might well ſuperſede any further enquiry. But we will leav nothing unanſwered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for proceed to examin, whether the Bilding be better than the Foundation.</p>
               <p>I will not fence with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Let it (for me) ſignify as it is tranſlated, and the Moſt too, that ſo it can import. But what then? <hi>To what purpoſe</hi> (asks our author) <hi>ſhould a man examin himſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that whether we look Far or Neer, we cannot miſs of Purpoſes ſufficient. If we look far off, to the days of old, Both <hi>Philoſophers</hi> among the Heathen, and <hi>Fathers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, recommend This exerciſe, as moſt uſeful to Excellent, thogh Other purpoſes. But we need not go ſo Far, nor any Farther than the Same book which asks the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The end</hi> (ſaith it) of <hi>Examination is,</hi> that 1. <hi>We griev

               </p>
               <p>And further, to recommend Frequency in this exerciſe, he reckoneth ſeveral fruits of it, <q>The oftener <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> we recollect our ſelvs, <hi>1.</hi> The more weakneſſes we ſhall obſerv, and <hi>2.</hi> more faults correct, and <hi>3.</hi> watch the better, and <hi>4.</hi> Repent more perfectly, and <hi>5.</hi> offend leſs, and <hi>6.</hi> be more prepared for death, and <hi>7.</hi> be more humbl, and <hi>8.</hi> with eaſe prevent the contracting of evil habits, and <hi>9.</hi> interrupt the union of litl ſins into a chain of death, and <hi>10.</hi> more readily prevail upon our paſſions, <hi>11.</hi> better underſtand our ſelvs, and <hi>12.</hi> more frequently converſ with God, and <hi>13.</hi> oftener pray, and <hi>14.</hi> have a more heavenly converſation, and in fine <hi>15.</hi> be more fitted for a frequent and holy Communion.</q> By This time one would think the Queſtion abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Proponent Himſelf: Yet may we go on, for 16. we ſhall <hi>ſtand in aw of our ſelvs and not ſin in private,</hi> Pſ. 4. and 17. <hi>we ſhall rejoice in our ſelvs and not in others,</hi> Gal. 6.4. and 18. <hi>ſearching our ways turn to God,</hi> Lam. 3.40. and 19. by ſeeing our progreſs already made, take corage to go on, and 20.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>NEGATIVELY,</hi> I anſwer, that to <hi>examin a mans ſelf</hi> before he do Such or Such an action, doth not import a Forbearance of That action, if upon ſuch <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> he do not approve himſelf: And in the place now under ey, there is not the leaſt Intimation in the Words, nor the leaſt Reaſon in the Context, to make it probabl, that the Apoſtl So intended, but much to the Contrary.</p>
               <p>And here I take our worthy Author at his word. <q>
                     <hi>It is a</hi> Relative duty and nothing of it's ſelf; for no man is the better for being examined if there follow nothing after it.</q> True, but we have found it attended with ſo Large and Noble a train of good conſequences, that we cannot ſay <hi>Nothing follows it,</hi> tho Forbearance from this duty make not One in the number: Sure it is, the Apoſtl hath here no ſervice for This Forbearance, but rather excludes it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Pythagoras</hi> again and again importuneth his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that <hi>before they ſuffer their eyes to ſleep, they thrice examin themſelvs concerning the paſt days actions;</hi> he was never thoght to forbid them to ſleep, unleſs upon ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted examination, they approved themſelvs Do you now ask <hi>to what purpoſe</hi> it is So to examin? he ſwears by the higheſt, that it is the <hi>way to a divine life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Seneca</hi> giveth account of his own conſtancy in this exerciſe, he expreſly declareth the effect was to warn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſaying, <hi>take heed, do ſo no more, for this time I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee.</hi> Do you now ask <hi>to what purpoſe?</hi> You ſee, not
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59001:156"/> to Condemn, but to Pardon and Admoniſh ones ſelf.</p>
               <p>What? Is there no other fruit of <hi>Self-examination,</hi> but <hi>Self-excommunication?</hi> Doth Religion, Doth the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel, more diſable us from Pardoning our ſelvs, than Reaſon did <hi>Seneca?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what need we look ſo far? The Apoſtl is of age, let him anſwer himſelf. Doth he ſay [Let a man examin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whether he be Worthy or no? and accordingly Com or Fearbear?] Yea, doth he ſpeak in <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s ſtile? Doth he ſay [Let not any man eat this bread, till he have examined and approved himſelf.] This would ſound ſo Like a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> that He might be excuſabl, who ſhould ſo underſtand it:</p>
               <p>And wer we ſo to have be'n forbidden, it had be'n ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary (as we have already pleaded) that the <hi>Prohibition</hi> ſhould have be'n as expreſs as our <hi>Lords Command;</hi> and not ſo Ambiguos that an honeſt heart might miſs it. But here is nothing of ſuch an aſpect. Yea</p>
               <p>He is equally <hi>poſitive</hi> for Both Performances, <hi>[Let a man Eat]</hi> is no leſs Imperative, than <hi>[Let a man examin himſelf.]</hi> He Equally injoineth Both, and therefor Both ar Equally <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> and any man may as lawfully forbear the One as the Other; and Both, as Either.</p>
               <p>What therefor he hath ſo Joined together, no man may Put Aſunder; yea, what he hath made Subordinate, no man may make Oppoſite.</p>
               <p>For it is further conſiderabl, that Thoſe two duties ar not Yoked together as Equals (which (yet) had be'n ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to forbid the One to draw contrary to the Other) but ar <hi>Subordinate,</hi> as <hi>Lord and Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Examination,</hi> however excellent a duty, hath Here no other Place or Buſineſs, but to ſerv This favorite exerciſe; and we may now take up our Saviors argument; Eating <hi>was not made for</hi> Examination, <hi>but</hi> Examination <hi>for Eating;</hi> wherefor Eating <hi>is Lord alſo of</hi> Examination: And that the Servant ſhould drive the Lord out of his Own doors
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59001:156"/> and eſtate; is not more againſt Juſtice; than it is againſt the <hi>Apoſtl's intention,</hi> that Examination ſhould barr a man from Eating.</p>
               <p>If therefor any one perſiſt in examining Examination it ſelf, urging <hi>[To what purpoſe?]</hi> This may well be the firſt clauſ of the anſwer, That it muſt Not be to ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a <hi>purpoſe,</hi> as to Forbid the Performance it oght to ſerv: and we may proceed to</p>
               <p n="3">III. 2. OUR <hi>Poſitive anſwer</hi> to clear the Apoſtl's meaning His Purpoſe is to ſerv his main Deſign; to prevent the <hi>Sin,</hi> he Pleadeth againſt, and the <hi>Error,</hi> he Diſputeth againſt.</p>
               <p>If they knew not, that thogh <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was concerned in Thoſe their meetings; he warns them of the danger of <hi>omitting</hi> the indiſpenſibl duty, by <hi>[So let him Eat.]</hi> If they knew it, and yet feared not to Profane it; he warns them of that That danger, by <hi>[Let a man examin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ask not now <hi>[to what purpoſe]</hi> but <hi>Upon what Subject</hi> muſt we examin our ſelvs?</p>
               <p>It is [we ar told] a <hi>Relative duty;</hi> Whereto then muſt it <hi>Relate? Relata</hi> muſt be <hi>aequalia;</hi> and for That reaſon we muſt Meſure the <hi>One by the Other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Murderer be brought to examination, and the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer examin him concerning <hi>Adultery,</hi> or concerning ſom <hi>School-probleme,</hi> &amp;c. we might perhaps commend his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but (ſure) not his Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>That therefor we may duly perform This exerciſe, we muſt firſt examin the Deſign; and then Our Selvs, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Thereto.</p>
               <p>The Deſign is apparently the <hi>Prevention of That</hi> ſin whereof the <hi>Corinthians</hi> wer guilty. That Sin was their <hi>[not diſcerning the Lords body]</hi> nor treating it with ſuch Diſtance, as oght to have be'n put between That and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread: but abuſing his Fleſh and Bloud in his Church,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59001:157"/> with the ſame rudeneſs, as they did That of their Cattel and their Grape in theit Own Houſes.</p>
               <p>This was the Sore, and to This muſt the Plaſter be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Why muſt the Plaſter be ſo much larger than the Sore? Why muſt we <hi>examin our ſelvs</hi> concerning ſuch Actions, or Worthineſs; whoſe knowledge hath no Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon this Performance, but only Oppoſit and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Such an Examination as ſhall <hi>excommunicat,</hi> if not the Whole, certainly the Greateſt part of mankind?</p>
               <p>He that ſhall moſt carefully perform his examination; firſt in That manner, which the <hi>Apoſtl preſcribeth,</hi> by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the infinite Diſtance of dignity, between the <hi>Lords table</hi> and his Own: and then in That Manner that our Worthy Author preſcribeth, between our Lords Body, and his Own Soul; tho he be the Beſt of his age, yea, the beſt (our Lord only excepted) that ever was, will moſt clearly diſcover, not only that he is Now Unworthy; but that he muſt deſpere Ever to be Otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Since then the Beſt Examination, of the Beſt Perſon, will carry him, not only Beyond, but Contrary to the Apoſtl's Deſign; Since it will put ſuch an Inconſiſtency between the Two Precepts, that <hi>[Let a man examin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf]</hi> will inferr <hi>[Let him Not Eat]</hi> and ſince the Apoſtl doth not in any kind Intimate, that our Worthineſs, but plainly Declare that our Differencing This from <hi>Common bread and wine,</hi> is to be ſubject of our Examination;</p>
               <p n="4">IV. HIS Meaning in the words now under vieu, can be no More, nor Other than This, <hi>Let a man examin himſelf,</hi> whether he well Underſtand, and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what he is <hi>about to Do?</hi> Whether he put the due Eſtimate upon what he is <hi>about to Receve?</hi> Whether he put as great Difference between the <hi>Lords ſupper</hi> and a <hi>Common feſt;</hi> as there is between the vertues of a litl <hi>Common Bread and Wine,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Body and Bloud of Chriſt?</hi> Whether he go to <hi>gratify his ſenſual appetite,</hi> with Eating
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59001:157"/> and Drinking? or to <hi>comply with his governors or neighbors,</hi> in communicating with them? or to <hi>feſt his ſoul</hi> with Thankfulneſs and Love toward his crucified Savior, with Joy and Delight in Communion with him, and ſuch other <hi>acts of devotion</hi> as ſo Holy an office requireth?</p>
               <p>Let a man well examin himſelf concerning this, and <hi>So let him Eat,</hi> with appetites ſuitabl.</p>
               <p>This I ſay is all that the Apoſtl's Deſign can Permit, or his Words Declare him to mean, by <hi>[Let a man examin himſelf]</hi> He requireth us to look Forward, not Backward; upon what we ar <hi>Going to do,</hi> in the Church, not upon what we <hi>Have already do'n</hi> there, or elſwhere; upon the Difference, between This and Other Bread; not upon That, between Our Own and <hi>Other mens ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet to prevent miſconſtructions I add this <hi>Proviſo:</hi> That I neither pretend to diſparage the moſt <hi>Severe ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,</hi> as it takes account of our <hi>Paſt actions,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate</hi> of ſoul; (For I dare ſwear with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that <hi>it is the high-way to divine life</hi>): Nor to deny that our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to <hi>This holy ſupper,</hi> is the Moſt Proper ſeaſon, for This <hi>moſt Excellent</hi> exerciſe (For he that beſt performeth the One, will undoubtedly beſt perform the Other.)</p>
               <p>All that I deny is this, That the Apoſtl, in <hi>This place,</hi> ſetteth up <hi>Examining our ſelvs,</hi> againſt <hi>Obeying our Lord;</hi> ſo as to Forbid any one to Eat, if upon examination he find himſelf Unworthy.</p>
               <p>And I further add (thohg I have no ſuch need) that if it wer Doubtful, yea if it wer highly Probabl; If he had ſo worded his precept, that in a Plauſibl appearance, it might ſignify ſom ſuch <hi>intention;</hi> yet is not a Probabl Sound of any One expreſſion, worthy to be ballanced, againſt ſo <hi>Expreſs a command</hi> of our Lord, and ſo <hi>induſtrious an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor</hi> of the ſame Apoſtl to urge it, as we have found in the Context.

I HAVE now do'n what I propoſed as Neceſſary, and all that I conceve Poſſibl, for a full diſcovery of the Apoſtl's meaning, in That unhappy diſcourſ, which as it is the Only Comment we have upon our <hi>Lords Inſtitution;</hi> ſo hath ſhared it's ſufferings; ſomtimes Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated, ſomtimes Racked, ſomtimes Rob'd of it's due ſens, ſomtimes Laden with more than it can bear; and by all ways Tormented; that it may ſay ſomthing in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of That Omiſſion, which he deſigned to Prevent or Condemn.</p>
               <p>I have given ſo regular and <hi>exact account</hi> of every Word, and every Aſpect of words; that as I am ſure no man ever Hath, ſo I may boldly believ no man ever Will, match it with any other.

               <p>That he cannot intend to Forbid Every perſon that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf Unworthy; or to make Self-examination an Hinderance to the Performance which it is to Serv.

               <p>If therefor we will appeal to Scripture, and take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way to Underſtand it; we ar upon as Secure ground, as any Rules can make us, Yet ſhall we quit This <hi>place of Advantage,</hi> and deſcend to the <hi>Plain field,</hi> allowing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to plead, what it can to the contrary.</p>
               <p>But before we can reach the Plain, we ar encountered with a Midl ſort of Evidences (ſhall I call them) or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, laid upon Scripture ground; precarios Allegories, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to a pretence of Reaſon.</p>

COVENANT, This Notion we muſt not contemn, bicauſ it carrieth our Lords authority. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>is the cup of the New Teſtament</hi> (or <hi>Covenant) in My bloud;</hi> plainly ballanceing the New Covenant, againſt the Old; and his Own Bloud againſt that of the ſacrificed Heifer, which we find ſtiled <hi>the bloud of ſprinkling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefor muſt be ſo Sprinkled, as That was, upon the Whole promiſcuos Peopl; not to diſtinguiſh the Elect from the Reprobate; but as <hi>Then the Jew,</hi> ſo <hi>Now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> from a <hi>Heathen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Even in the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> ther was Fleſh and Spirit, the Seed of the Loins, and the Seed of the Faith. <hi>He was not a Jew which was one Outwardly, and Circumciſion was not of the Fleſh, but the Spirit, whoſe Praiſe was not of Man but of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet that outward Performance which had no Praiſe, if unaccompanied with the Spirit, was Neceſſary, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; ſufficient to Condemn if Omitted, thogh not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Approve it Naked.</p>
               <p>Thus was it in the Old, and thus is it in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: The Sacraments ar Outwatd badges; every Viſibl Chriſtian muſt wear them, that his Profeſſion may be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibl; but No man may <hi>Reſt in them,</hi> as ſufficient for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For Thoſe only have a right to the <hi>Promiſes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> who perform it's Condicions: to All the reſt, the Covenant is loſt; and conſequently, ſo ar the Seals. Yet doth This no more Prohibit, or Diſpens, with a mere Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chriſtan, to receve the Sacrament; than it did a <hi>Jew,</hi> to receve Circumciſion, keep the Sabath, or wear any other Cogniſance preſcribed by the Law. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. TO SEAL a Covenant, importeth an Obligation for the Future, not an Account of the Paſt. The Apoſtl tells the <hi>Galations,</hi> that <hi>He that is Circumciſed is a debter to keep the whole Law;</hi> not that he is diſcharged, as having Kept it.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:59001:159"/>
               <p>We therefor moſt willingly grant what ever the Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry demands, <hi>viz.</hi> That by <hi>Doing This,</hi> we new <hi>Seal</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> made in Baptiſm. Repete all our Vows, New tye all our Obligations, which our Corruptions or Infirmities, may have ſlackened ſince the laſt Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But to ſay, that bicauſ <hi>This is the Seal of the Covenant,</hi> therefor none may receve it, who hath not already perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all it's Articls; is to ſay, that no man may ſeal an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, who hath not already do'n what thereby he Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanteth to do. <hi>i. e.</hi> It is not Lawful, 'till it be Needleſs.</p>
               <p>LET the otherwiſe minded be requeſted to conſider. Ar not all the congregations promiſcuos, obliged to make <hi>pubik profeſſion of their Faith?</hi> And doth not Faith import Holineſs? Where then is the Difference, what the Reaſon, why he who is not in Covenant in the ſtricteſt ſens, may not as well Communicate in the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> as he who hath not Faith in the ſtricteſt ſens, may <hi>Profeſs his belief.</hi> I can ſhew a reaſon why he may Better do it; but can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin none, why he may not do it as Well.</p>
               <p>He that publikly maketh <hi>Profeſſion of his Faith,</hi> declareth himſelf to <hi>Have Faith:</hi> and if he have it not, he is a Lyar, a notorios Lyar, a ſolen Lyar, in the face of <hi>God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> But he that <hi>Receveth the Sacrament,</hi> maketh no ſuch boſt: Vaunteth not as the Young man in the Goſpel, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth up.</hi> Saith not I have Paid, but I am a Debtor to the whole Goſpel; and thankfully embrace it's gratios offers, made by my Lord, and purchaſed with his Bloud.</p>
               <p>This is plain Sens, and This is conſtant Practice. If therefor it be a kind of Forgery, to <hi>ſet this Seal</hi> to a <hi>Blank;</hi> it is no leſs Criminal, to <hi>Tear it off</hi> from our <hi>Lords Charter,</hi> which giveth every <hi>Viſibl Chriſtian</hi> a Right to it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. AT OTHER times we ar told, we ar not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our <hi>Lords Body,</hi> if we be not his <hi>Members;</hi> and his <hi>Members</hi> we ar not, if we have not his Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:59001:160"/>
               <p>Be it ſo, This will not exclude <hi>Any Christian;</hi> For St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith: <hi>Hereby know we the Spirit of God. Every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is com'n in the fleſh, is of God:</hi> by which we perceive, what Latitude the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is capabl of, and what force there is in the Allegory.</p>
               <p>That the whole Body and every particular Member, muſt partake the ſame <hi>Fleſh and Bloud,</hi> the whole Crearion forbids us to deny: That the <hi>Church is the body of Chriſt, and every one of us Members in particular,</hi> the Apoſtl hath expreſsly taght us: The concluſion muſt needs be, that the celebration of This Sacrament, is the Duty, both of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church, and every Member.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adminiſtration of Sacraments</hi> is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged an eſſential requiſite of a <hi>true Church;</hi> and it muſt be very ſtrange, if the Reception of them, ſhould not be ſo of a true Member of ſuch a Church.</p>
               <p>BUT as it is in <hi>All Natural</hi> bodies, ſo is it in <hi>This My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical.</hi> Every Member muſt have both <hi>Outward Frame,</hi> and <hi>Inward Spirits,</hi> anſwerabl to its place in the Body, and its relation to the Head. And every <hi>Member of Chriſt</hi> muſt anſwer it's relation, both by an <hi>Outward Profeſſion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Life;</hi> whereof thogh the Former be Inſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Later; yet is it Neceſſary, in Order thereto. For by <hi>outward Offices</hi> of worſhip, we do not onely Exerciſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, when we have it; but Diſpoſe our ſelvs to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein it.</p>
               <p>So there is a Two fold Memberſhip: By the One we Ptofeſs our ſelvs Chriſtians, by the Other we Are ſo: Yea, by <hi>That very Profeſſion,</hi> we Ar ſo far So, as to be both Intitl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Priviledges, and Obliged to all Duties, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Members of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. AGAIN we ar told, That <hi>This is the Bread of Sons and muſt not be given to Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Former clauſ,</hi> if the <hi>Syrophaenician</hi> woman hath not anſwered, our Lord himſelf hath: For in directing us to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59001:160"/> call God Father, he hath given as a right to the Bread, as well as the title of Sons. And to the Later, the Apoſtl hath furniſhed us with an anſwer. <hi>For if when we wer Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Chriſt died for us;</hi> if our Enmity did not hinder him from giving us his Bloud it ſelf; much leſs will it, from allowing us it's <hi>Repreſentative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Catechiſm teacheth us to ſay, <hi>I was by Baptiſm made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> And though we know that the <hi>waſhing away of the filth of the fleſh,</hi> will be far from Saving us, if we anſwer it not <hi>by a good conſcience toward God:</hi> Yet is every Baptiſed and Unexcommunicate perſon, however unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, admitted to the priviledge of joining with the Church, in All ſuch Offices, as call God our Father, and Chriſt our Head: And All ſuch perſons ar honored by the title of <hi>Faithful,</hi> in the writings of the Apoſtl's and Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is urged as neceſſary to incorporate into <hi>Chriſts viſibl body,</hi> even thoſe who ar not capabl to underſtand it. <hi>Hearing</hi> is preſſed as a duty upon thoſe who <hi>receve not the truth in the Love thereof. Prayer</hi> is required even of thoſe, who by their actions ſhew themſelvs <hi>not to be the Sons of God,</hi> and therefor when they pray may not properly ſay, <hi>Our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is no leſs a Sacrament, than Baptiſm; and more a <hi>worſhip of Chriſt,</hi> than either <hi>Hearing</hi> or <hi>Praying.</hi> Yea, <hi>All other Offices</hi> put together, do not ſo much advance his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal honor as this One. And is it not ſtrange, that when <hi>All the reſt</hi> ar <hi>required, This alone</hi> ſhould be Prohibited? and That, upon no other reaſon, but what is <hi>common to All?</hi> And being put home, will no leſs rob <hi>Chriſt of All honor,</hi> than his <hi>Members of all Priviledges?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. THIS therefore is our General anſwer to All Objections of This kind. <hi>Many ar called, but few choſen. Outward Offices</hi> belong to the Called, <hi>Inward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:59001:161"/> to the Choſen. The Former ar both ways condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether they neglect to joyn with the Church of Chriſt in open Profeſſion, or by the unſuitablneſs of their Lives, giv the Ly to That Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>And This differeth no otherwiſe from <hi>Other Offices,</hi> but in This, That our <hi>Saviors Perſon</hi> is more honored by it: and if it require ſo much the greater care in the <hi>Manner,</hi> ſo doth it alſo in the <hi>Thing;</hi> if we muſt be ſo much the more careful How we Do it, ſo muſt we be, That do not Omit it.</p>
               <p>And this is ſufficient not only to Anſwer, but <hi>make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Allegorical Objections;</hi> which indeed I ſhould hardly have taken ſuch notice of, did they not ſerv as Illuſtrations of our duty. For to no other purpoſe do our adverſaries produce them. Theſe ar but their <hi>Velites,</hi> their main ſtrength follows.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> A Deſcent from Scripture to Reaſon. The caſe now differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what it was formerly. <hi>II. 1.</hi> Bicauſe the very Being of the Sacrament is hazarded. <hi>III.</hi> Every ſtep from Conſtancy, an approche to That danger.

More hope of reformation. A Proteſt againſt encorageing irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Three good ends laid down, which the Sacrament is fit to promote, but diſabled by diſuſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HATEVER we have hitherto ſeen, either of Scripture or Reaſon thereupon bilt, hath be'n ſo ſhort of worthy to be ballanced againſt our <hi>Lords Command,</hi> his <hi>Apoſtl's Explication,</hi> or his <hi>Churches Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> that I cannot think it credibl, any one hath thereby be'n induced to entertene a thoght preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to them. But rather, that Pios perſons finding the Sacrament to have loſt much of it's honor, and it's power, by ſo Conſtant exerciſe; conceving it might be both more Serviceabl to Godlineſs, and more Eſteemed it Self, if it
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59001:162"/> had more Aw with leſs Frequence; and encoraged by the exampl of <hi>Former Ages,</hi> who for the like reaſons had made <hi>great alterations:</hi> took Thoſe Examples for their Guides, and Thoſe good Intentions for their Meſures; and wer more induſtrios to interpret the Scriptures by ſuch <hi>good Ends;</hi> than to conform their Doctrines to the Scriptures; now grown obſcure, and hardly intelligibl, by loſs of That Key which alone was capable to unlock them.</p>
               <p>It is therefor now made a point of Diſcretion, and that I may pay our Lord the Honor due to his Wiſdom, as well as the Obedience due to his Command; I muſt from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniabl authority of Scripture proceed to conſider what Reaſon will determin.</p>
               <p>I muſt therefor now ſuppoſe (what I have all this while be'n diſproving) that the Indulged ſens of the diſputed words, is the True one; that they give an ampl Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to govern our (Obedience I was wont to ſay, I now ſay) Performance, by our Diſcretion. I muſt further grant (what I wiſh I could deny) that we cannot be ſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv our Reverence to the Inſtitution, without quitting, not only rigid Conſtancy, but Tolerabl Frequency; and upon Theſe diſadvantages com to this humbl queſtion:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether the caſe ſtanding as now it doth, it will more conduce to the Service of the Sacrament and it's Author; to receve it ſeldom, if at all; than Conſtantly or Frequently?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>[the caſe standing as now it doth]</hi> For I think I can never too often profeſs, that I exalt not my ſelf againſt thoſe <hi>Venerable perſons,</hi> whether of the laſt or former ages; who wer they now living, would (doubtleſs) change their <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the queſtion,</hi> with the <hi>changed ſtate of the Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. AND FIRST I take it for very conſiderabl, that the difference between the State of the queſtion Now, and Heretofore, is the ſame as <hi>Caeſar</hi> declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the battail of <hi>Munda</hi> and Other battails; In Others, he fought for Honor; in That, for Life. And queſtionleſs,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59001:162"/> Thoſe who thinking it Secure from total Deſertion, thoght fit to Hazard ſomewhar of Frequency; would not have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the very Being of ſo great a <hi>Duty,</hi> if they had imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in danger.</p>
               <p>It is the ſingular unhappineſs of <hi>This onely Office;</hi> that it is <hi>laid aſide</hi> upon pretence it cannot defend it ſelf. There is the ſame danger in <hi>Hearing</hi> or <hi>Praying,</hi> as in <hi>Receiving Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.</hi> That is by the Apoſtl declared a <hi>Savor of death unto death;</hi> and This by the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> is ſtiled an <hi>Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Yet is <hi>That</hi> ſtill <hi>preached,</hi> and <hi>This</hi> ſtill <hi>practiſed.</hi> Be they never ſo <hi>ill uſed</hi> by their Enemies, they ar not therefor deſerted by their Friends, bicauſ <hi>unproſperos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be pleaded, that the Sacrament is not <hi>Laid aſide</hi> as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs,</hi> but <hi>Lock't up as Precios:</hi> I anſwer, that I very well remember, when to <hi>Secure</hi> a perſon ſignified to <hi>Impriſon</hi> him; and in <hi>This caſe,</hi> whatever the <hi>Intention</hi> be, the <hi>Effect</hi> is the ſame. Action is the very Being of the Sacrament, from which if it be <hi>lock't up,</hi> it is <hi>loſt,</hi> both to it's <hi>ſelf,</hi> and all other <hi>purpoſes;</hi> which By it, and not Without it, it is Appointed and Fit to promote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Lord</hi> ſtamped it with his <hi>own Image and ſuperſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> not that it might be lock't up as a <hi>Medal,</hi> but <hi>Uſed</hi> as <hi>Money;</hi> whoſe <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> it is, ſo to repreſent the King, as to anſwer all the needs and conveniences of the Poſſeſſor. He therefor moſt honoreth ir, who ſo employeth it, as may beſt anſwer our <hi>Lords good Ends;</hi> not he that <hi>locketh</hi> it up as the <hi>Miſer</hi> doth his <hi>Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt therefor conſider, there is an <hi>Extreme</hi> on That ſide alſo: if Prodigality be a vice; So, and perhaps more than So, is <hi>Covetoſneſs.</hi> Suppoſe there be <hi>Danger,</hi> that the more we <hi>

               <p n="3">III. <hi>EVERY ſtep</hi> whereby our Predeceſſors <hi>departed</hi> from <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> was an <hi>approach</hi> toward this <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> And thoſe who <hi>firſt adventured</hi> to paſs from unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>Reception,</hi> to unworthineſs in the <hi>Recever;</hi> ſo as to prohibit <hi>ſcandalos Perſons,</hi> as well as <hi>ſcandalos Behavior;</hi> opened a <hi>Sluce</hi> to miſchief they thoght not <hi>Credibl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet while the <hi>Prohibition</hi> was a point of Diſcipline, not of Doctrine; while it lay onely upon <hi>Individuals</hi> not <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;</hi> nor <hi>Individuals</hi> neither, 'till <hi>cenſured</hi> by the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> ſo that no man was allowed to do what he pleaſed; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one Required to com unleſs he wer cut off from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, and thereby driven, as well from the <hi>Lords Houſ,</hi> as his <hi>Tabl;</hi> not to be reſtored, but after long penances, and bitter tears, and humbl proſtrations, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayers, all openly and conſtantly repered at the Church porch, for ſeveral years; there appeared no danger, that any one would <hi>voluntarily abſent</hi> himſelf, thinking it <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> to com or forbear.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>This very Diſcipline</hi> may well be urged as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary. For the <hi>Sentence of the Biſhop</hi> did not <hi>Direct</hi> what the cenſured perſon voluntarily Do, but Inflict what he muſt Suffer: And as no Judge Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59001:163"/> any <hi>Offender</hi> to Execute himſelf, ſo did none of the Fathers of thoſe times ever require any, however ſcandalos, to <hi>excommunicate himſelf;</hi> which would have be'n look't upon as a dubl Crime, <hi>viz. Diſobedience to our Lords Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and <hi>Invaſion</hi> of <hi>the Biſhops Office,</hi> to whom the power of <hi>Excommunication</hi> belonged.</p>
               <p>It was not therefor the Doctrine of Thoſe times to teach it Indifferent to any one to Com or Forbear at pleaſure: but it was their Diſcipline to deny our <hi>Lords Livree</hi> to ſuch, as by his <hi>Stewards</hi> wer <hi>judged</hi> worthy to be Driven out of his houſe; untill by the <hi>ſame Stewards</hi> they ſhould be judged worthy to be Reſtored, both to a <hi>Capacity</hi> and <hi>Obligation,</hi> of <hi>communicating in All</hi> Offices of his worſhip.</p>
               <p>But it is too frequent that Wickedneſs overcometh Law: and in proceſs of time and impiety, it ſo <hi>Overcame,</hi> as to take it's full <hi>Revenge</hi> upon This <hi>Diſcipline: Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> it, and with it all the power of Thoſe ſevere words of the Fathers of thoſe times, which are to be meſured by it, as belonging to <hi>none but Penitents, i. e.</hi> to perſons <hi>cenſured,</hi> and therefor obliged to <hi>ſuffer</hi> ſeparation from <hi>That Altar,</hi> to which they had (for the time) loſt their right by a juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Sentence.</p>
               <p>The ſum is this; <hi>The Diſcipline of Thoſe times,</hi> and the Fathers who enforced <hi>That Diſcipline,</hi> intended not to <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Communion it ſelf from the Church,</hi> nor to <hi>Impower</hi> Any one to ſeparat Himſelf from her <hi>Communion;</hi> but only to deterr <hi>ſentenced Perſons</hi> from intruding upon it; and how <hi>great a gulf</hi> there is between theſe, is ſufficiently viſibl.</p>
               <p>Yet great as it is, we find it jumped over, the Riſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>That Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> and the well meant deſires of the Later; who loth to loſe ſo uſeful a Curb, yet unabl to reſtore the Diſcipline to it's long loſt power, Interpreted the ſevere ſayings of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, not by the <hi>Authors</hi> minds, but their <hi>Own:</hi> require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one to be a <hi>Biſhop to himſelf,</hi> to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> himſelf, if upon impartial Examination, he ſhould find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59001:164"/> Worthy of ſuch a ſentence: and This unhappily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraged men to believ that it was in their own power to Judge whether it wer fit to Com or Forbear.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THIS I ſay gave the Riſe; but if we had <hi>ſtaid here,</hi> no harm had be'n done; ſince none but <hi>groſly ſcandalos</hi> would appear <hi>excommunicabl:</hi> For ſuch ſins ſtand in a mans Way, ſtare in his Face, roar in his Ears, are Notorios to the Whole Church; and therefor need none of thoſe Schemes, whereby we ar directed in our Self-examination, to Search for Lurking ſins, which ar not to be Diſcovered, but by the <hi>stricteſt enquiry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I cannot but applaud the Wiſdom and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our <hi>Church,</hi> who doth not (as ſom of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors) Excommunicate, but Warn; not ſuch Qualities, as the Greater, and Leſs Scandalous, (and therefor not-upon-ſuch-accounts <hi>excommunicabl</hi>) part of the peopl, muſt upon ſtrict examination, find themſelvs in <hi>ſom degree guilty</hi> of; but ſuch <hi>[Great and Grievos crimes]</hi> as the guilty perſons, yea all their neighborhood, cannot <hi>avoid knowing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuch, I ſay, ſhe doth not downright <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> but <hi>Warn;</hi> the Difference between which two Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, may be underſtood by that, between her Preſent and Former Stile.</p>
               <p>Before the Late and Litl alterations in our <hi>Common-prayer Book,</hi> ſhe ſpake Copulatively; <hi>Bewail your ſins</hi> [AND] <hi>com not;</hi> but now Disjunctively <hi>Repent of your ſins</hi> [OR ELS] <hi>com not:</hi> By which change, that ſhe intends not to leav it to our option as Indifferent, whether we will repent and <hi>Com,</hi> or remain impenitent and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear;</hi> we have ſeen her to have ſufficiently declared, by <hi>another exhortation,</hi> wherein ſhe clearly cenſures ſuch a Forbearance, to be it ſelf a very <hi>Great and Grievos crime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had her beſt ſons followed her Exampl, poſſibly the holy office might have be'n a Gainer; certainly it had be'n
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59001:164"/> Safe, as from Profanation on One ſide, ſo from Deſertion on the Other; and ſo had every good Chriſtian be'n, both from Diſobedience and Unworthineſs.</p>
               <p>Som in St. <hi>Jude's time</hi> and <hi>account,</hi> wer <hi>ſpots in the</hi> Churches <hi>feſts of charity,</hi> thogh indeed they wer None of her Members; for they <hi>denied our only Lord God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet is not the <hi>Church</hi> her ſelf blamed for <hi>not wipeing</hi> them out.</p>
               <p>Again, there is great difference between <hi>Having</hi> a Spot, and <hi>Being</hi> One; and Yet again, there is great difference between <hi>Spots;</hi> for the word of God himſelf telling us, by way of diſcrimination, that Som mens ſpots <hi>ar not the ſpots of his children,</hi> Deut. 32.5. Plainly enogh intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Others ar ſo: And certainly thoſe Spots which hinder not a perſon from being a <hi>child,</hi> muſt not Diſherit him from a Childs Portion or a Childs Duty. Yet ſtill thoſe pios perſons <hi>meant well,</hi> and ſaw no danger in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure; at leaſt, none to the holy <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The <hi>Dictates</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> wer Then Reverenced, and her Injunctions Obeyed; yea the very Scandaloſneſs of it in the eyes of the Peopl, made it look like impoſſibl, that Any Perſon, much more that <hi>any conſiderabl Number of perſons,</hi> ſhould ſink into ſuch <hi>non-conformity,</hi> both to our <hi>Lord's Inſtitution,</hi> and the <hi>Churches Conſtitutions;</hi> as to deny this poor <hi>Quitrent,</hi> this ſlight <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of Three times at leaſt, which however ſhort of the full due, might yet ſerv to keep the <hi>right alive,</hi> and in ſom kind anſwer that indulgent law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not indeed in the <hi>Cauſ,</hi> but the <hi>Event.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For That, upon pure Neceſſity, commuted Conſtant offering <hi>every beaſt</hi> they eat, into Conſtant journying thrice a year to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> thereby to recompence <hi>loſs in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> by <hi>improvement in ſolemnity.</hi> And our Church upon <hi>another kind of Neceſſity,</hi> derived, not from the Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cableneſs of the <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>hardneſs of the peopls hearts,</hi> was fain to admit the ſame commutation.</p>
               <p>Our Former Writers lived in ſuch times, as never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59001:165"/> the neceſſity of doing <hi>ſo much at leaſt,</hi> and ſuited their precepts to Their <hi>own times;</hi> not to Theſe Dregs of error and impiety, wherein our <hi>Lords remembrancer</hi> is it ſelf Forgotten, his <hi>Monument</hi> it ſelf <hi>buried,</hi> and his whole <hi>Inſtitution</hi> ſo demoliſhed, that we ſcarce ſee any Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, but in Books; and even in Them, no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Obligation to perform it.</p>
               <p>It was indeed a very pios deſign So to manage Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and this Sacrament, that by mutual circulation they might aſſiſt each other. That the Requiſites of Saving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may bring men to <hi>worthineſs of the Sacrament;</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of coming Shortly to the Sacrament, may cut off the <hi>delay of repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But towards the Later Part of the deſign, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to aſſert the <hi>power of the Command;</hi> That ſo the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> may equal <hi>Repentance,</hi> as well in Neceſſity as in Difficulty.</p>
               <p>For it is incredibl that thoſe who ar not frighted to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> by the indiſpenſibl <hi>Neceſſity</hi> thereof; ſhould be ſo to this Sacrament, by any <hi>Leſs potent motive,</hi> if there ly the ſame <hi>formidabl Difficulties</hi> in the way.</p>
               <p n="5">V. I Say <hi>Leſs potent motives,</hi> for I muſt not deny our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy adverſary This right, that thogh he have loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the Obligation of the Command, whereby the Worſt ar tied to the Performance, as their Duty; yet hath he Recommended it by ſuch Incoragement, as muſt needs prevail upon all <hi>ſuch as himſelf, i. e.</hi> all tru <hi>lovers of the Lord</hi> Ieſus: thogh to lovers of their <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Eaſe,</hi> they be <hi>uſeleſs</hi> or <hi>worſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For to invite a <hi>Carnal App tite</hi> to a <hi>Spiritual Feſt,</hi> what is it but to <hi>fiſh with a jewel,</hi> whoſe very luſtre will Fright the fiſh it ſhould Allure?</p>
               <p>Tell the man of Bottels, that he cannot <hi>drink the Cup of the Lord</hi> and the Cup of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> but muſt be bound over to the languid dulneſs of Sobriety: Tell the amoros
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59001:165"/> Gallant, That this <hi>Fleſh of Chriſt</hi> will rob him of all <hi>ſtrange fleſh,</hi> and either confine him To One, or From All, his Loves: Tell the greedy <hi>Scraper,</hi> that this <hi>Heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> muſt be purchaſed with ſom diminution of his Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſcatter a good part his heaps among the Poor, and bind his hand ftom thoſe Gainful exerciſes, whereby he Gathered, and might further Increaſe them:</p>
               <p>What ar Theſe, and what ar All Other graces required to, or promiſed in This Sacrament, to a ſenſualiſt, but ſo many Warnings to ſtand upon the gard againſt ſuch Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>
               <p>And what could have be'n more do'n or deſired by it's <hi>mortal Enemies,</hi> toward a <hi>total extirpation</hi> of Any office, than to render it at once, Difficult, Dangeros, Needleſs, and Damageabl? All which concurr in the Honor to which our modern way of Reverence, hath exalted the H. S. in the eyes of the farr greateſt part of thoſe who ar to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceve it.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>One ſide,</hi> a formidabl <hi>Gandelope,</hi> between the Great Troubl of Preparation that we may com Worthily, and Greater Danger of coming Unworthily after the moſt Laborios Preparation: On the <hi>Other ſide,</hi> all Neceſſity of running it, taken away, by a Denial that we ly under any Command; and the ſuppletory Motive which ſhould encor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age us, is to the much greater part of the world, rather an Affrightment, than an Invitation.</p>
               <p>When therefore we look upon the Advantages we may hope from ſtreyning the condicions of <hi>Worthineſs,</hi> let us caſt one eye upon the Danger of loſing even the <hi>Sacrament it ſelf.</hi> When we hear the Opinions of Former ages, let us hearken to the Experience of our Own.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtl and Primitive Chriſtians</hi> had Great need to contend for the Manner: We have no Leſs, yea we have Gr ater, to contend for the Thing: I ſay we have Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for if the Thing be loſt, the Manner cannot but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with it.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:59001:166"/>VI. IF therefor the Reverſ be unanſwerabl, Then muſt Thoſe doctrines be more injurios to the H.S. which reach men to ſhun the <hi>Performance</hi> it ſelf; than were (I ſay not the debaucheries of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who ſo behaved themſelvs as <hi>not to Eat the Lords Supper,</hi> but) Any ſuch Leſs mortal <hi>Profanations,</hi> as may leav it a Being, thogh leſs Honorabl.</p>
               <p>And there ar two great reaſons (at leaſt) to believ that (as any Landlord would liefer have his rent paid in Baſe Mony, than wholely Witheld; ſo) our Lord would liefer have his Supper <hi>celebrated</hi> ſomwhat <hi>unworthily,</hi> than whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Omitted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Bicauſ <hi>Somthing</hi> is better than <hi>Nothing.</hi> No mony ſo baſe as not to be Somwhat worth: A Pepper-corn is ſomwhat in its ſelf; and ſo much more in its ſignificancy, as the Right which it acknowledgeth is greater. The very <hi>preſenting</hi> our ſelvs to the Lords table, is an act both of Worſhip and Obedience; whereas thoſe who <hi>turn their backs</hi> upon it, deny both Them, and our Lords Title to Them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Bicauſ there is more Hope to Reform any Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Manner,</hi> than to Retrive the <hi>Loſt Thing.</hi> This is not ſo viſibl in Any caſe as in the preſent.</p>
               <p>Againſt communicating <hi>Unwhorthily,</hi> the Apoſtl hath ſpoken ſo Much and ſo Loud; that if <hi>Reaſon</hi> wer Silent, yea if it wer Oppoſit, we would not avoid the evidence: But concerning our obligation to the <hi>Performance</hi> it ſelf, thogh in truth he ſpoke no leſs convictively to That Age, yet doth not Ours ſo fully underſtand it.</p>
               <p>His <hi>argument</hi> needeth more Strict and Skilful examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than moſt men ar able to make. Yea, his words (their key being loſt) ar obnoxios to be <hi>perverted;</hi> and that, not only by the Vulgar, but the Learned, to a ſens quite Contrary.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:59001:166"/>
               <p>And therefor in This, beyond Any caſe, it is dangeros to let the duty fall into Diſuſe; ſince the Luſts of the Peopl, will moſt readily concurr with the Error of the Prieſt, to bury it in deep forgetfulneſs; whereas Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in the <hi>Manner,</hi> may eaſier find Practice than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage; ſince every one hath knowlege enogh to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it uncapabl of Any.</p>
               <p>THOGH I have already ſaid ſufficient to the <hi>Candid,</hi> yet fully to ſecure my ſelf even againſt the <hi>malicios,</hi> I think fit more formally to proteſt againſt encoraging Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs or Irreverence.</p>
               <p>Should I ſay that it is a <hi>greater crime</hi> to <hi>Murder,</hi> than to <hi>Maim</hi> a man; this ſure would not bring me under any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of juſtifying that Great, (yet comparatively Leſs) injuſtice: Why then ſhould I be looked on as a <hi>patron of Unworthineſs,</hi> bicauſ I ſay it is Leſs criminal than <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience:</hi> or of <hi>Irreverence</hi> toward the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> thogh I ſay, we ar no more to be frighted from It, than from any Other worſhip?</p>
               <p>Thoſe who preſs Prayer as an indiſpenſibl Duty, to be performed more than once every day, ar ſecure enogh from any ſuch charge: and whence comes it, than there ſhould be greater Antipathy toward reverence, in the One than in the Other? Or why muſt This be more <hi>unable to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com,</hi> and more <hi>obliged to yield</hi> to, the corruptions of the votary, than That?</p>
               <p>If we have ſuch veneration to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> for its <hi>Own ſake;</hi> let us conſider <hi>what ſhall it profit, if it gain all poſſibl Reverence, and loſe its own Being?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If for our <hi>Lords ſake;</hi> let us remember, that if we For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it, upon a <hi>Reaſon</hi> which He thoght not Sufficient to hinder him from <hi>Commanding</hi> it; we honor his <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> above his <hi>Perſon,</hi> even by <hi>Neglecting it;</hi> and exalt our ſelfs at once againſt his <hi>Authority,</hi> by limiting his <hi>Law;</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> by pretending we know, better thin Himſelf, what is fit to be do'n for his ſervice.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:59001:167"/>
               <p>But here again we will continue our wonted Prodigality. And ſuppoſing that the <hi>Being</hi> of the Sacrament is ſecured: will further conſider that its Power is weakened, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently its Honor) in promoting all the good ends it is fit and deſigned to ſerv: which for brevity I ſhall reduce to three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The converſion of Sinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Comfort of the Godly.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Sacrament made uſeleſs toward Converſion.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> That it is made unſerviceabl toward converſion of a ſinner. Three propoſitions. <hi>1.</hi> To deny it a converting vertu is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to the Sacrament, and more ſo to our Lord. <hi>II.</hi> No danger to the Worthy, but the whole queſtion is about the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: and concerning them there is more hope than fear: five reaſons why the hope ſhould be embraced. <hi>III. 2.</hi> The Sacrament hath a converting vertu, Proved <hi>1.</hi> by the joint authority of the Apoſtls, and by conſideration of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtl's argument. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> uſed the ſame argument with the ſame unhappineſs. <hi>IV.</hi> No fear that ſuch stating the Argument, ſhould drive men as far from the Church as the Altar. <hi>V. 2.</hi> By Reaſon. <hi>1.</hi> The Death of Christ ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceabl to convert. That he ſuffered more for This end than any other, proved by Scripture and Reaſon. <hi>VI. 2.</hi> This Sacrament ſetteth forth Chriſt's death more powerfully than Preaching. We may not imagin that he will deny it his bleſſing. <hi>VII. 3.</hi> The converting power promoted by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetitions. A ſuppoſition that One ſolemn addreſs may be worth Twenty, examined. An hypotypoſis of ſuch a performance. <hi>1.</hi> Fregment offers hit one time or other. <hi>2.</hi> Repetition addeth new force to the former decaying act. <hi>3.</hi> Teacheth to act better. So it will help, not prejudice the performance in reſpect of the manner.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIRST it is plainly made <hi>Uſeleſs toward the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of unconverted ſinners,</hi> bicauſ All Such ar For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Yea, Not only thoſe who have no good Inclinations, but thoſe who have good Beginnings, yea thoſe who have
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59001:168"/> made good Progreſs; if yet they com ſhort of Any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification neceſſary to <hi>Complete ſaving repentance;</hi> ar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excluded from <hi>all Benefit,</hi> bicauſ they ar ſo, from <hi>all Uſe</hi> of it, by this ſentence, <hi>Bicauſ whatever diſpoſitions or alterations he may begin to have in order to pardon and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he as yet hath neither: but is Gods enemy and therefor cannot receve his holy ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Such therefor, the Sacrament can have No other power, but to <hi>Fright them away:</hi> or at beſt, if it offer any <hi>Invitation,</hi> it is ſuch as Nurſes uſe to Fallen Children; <hi>Com to me and I will help thee up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not to Help, but to Mock; and muſt ſuppoſe thoſe to be very <hi>children</hi> indeed, that can be incoraged by Such Exhortations, to Endeavor to raiſe themſelvs, or Thank their exhorter.</p>
               <p>For if Repentance muſt precede the Sacrament, then may it be the Cauſ but not the Effect; and may Diſpute againſt it, <hi>Thou beareſt not the Root, but the Root Thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other <hi>good fruits</hi> it may produce, Many and Great; but not This of converſion; which it muſt not influence as a <hi>Root,</hi> but attend as a <hi>Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How injurios this is, I ſhall indevor to ſhew by three Poſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is diſhonorabl to the Sacrament to deny it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting vertu, and more ſo to our Lord, to deny the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſuch a vertu if it have it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath a converting vertu.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That vertu is better exerciſed by Frequent than Rare exerciſe.</p>
               <p>FIRST, That <hi>it is diſhonorabl to the Sacrament to deny it a Couverting vertu,</hi> I might think the plaineſt propoſition in the world; ſince it is thereby robbed of the better half of it's power (for to have both a Converting and Confirming power, is more than dubl to the Later, without the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which is farr <hi>more Gracios.</hi>) But This is yet plainer,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59001:168"/> that it is farr leſs Sacrilegios <hi>to Rob the Sacrament</hi> of ſuch vertu; than to <hi>Blaſpheme our Lord,</hi> with an imagination that he ſhould deny Them, the benefit of the <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> for Whom he ſhed his <hi>Bloud it ſelf;</hi> when by This the Salvation may be Promoted, which he purchaſed by That.</p>
               <p>What a wretched Baffle wer this to the <hi>Apoſtls argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whereby he pleadeth <hi>He that denied us not his only Son, how ſhall he not with Him freel giv us all things?</hi> How doth it repreſent the infinite <hi>lover of mankind,</hi> as an <hi>envios malicios enemy,</hi> both to Them, and his own Bloud; by taking from Them the benefit, and from This the vertu, which was to Them moſt Neceſſary, and to This moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable?</p>
               <p>This way of <hi>Honoring</hi> our Lord is but the reverſ of That, whereby his enemies Reproched him. They blamed Him <hi>for Eating and Drinking with ſinners;</hi> and This doctrine forbids <hi>ſinners to Eat and Drink</hi> with Him. And Both ar fitted with his Own beſt anſwer, <hi>The whole need not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, but the ſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the Honor, bicauſ the Profeſſion of a Phyſician, to giv his company, Not to thoſe <hi>who moſt Deſerv,</hi> but to thoſe who <hi>moſt Need</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who ar already in the ſtate of Salvation, need not his <hi>Abilities</hi> as a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> to ſave their lives; thogh they do his Bounty, as a Feſter, to cheriſh and glad their hearts: The Godly injoy Many and Great, but Other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; ſuch as rather conduce to the advancement of their Happineſs, than their Safety, which is above ſuch need: They ar the Sick, they ar ſuch as ly in a ſtate of Miſery and Danger, who's need cry loudeſt for his <hi>Saving power:</hi> And to help ſuch he Came into the world, traveled about it, <hi>went</hi> out of it, and <hi>left</hi> this monument to continu <hi>in it, till he com again.</hi>

               <p n="2">II. AND concerning Such, is our whole queſtion. For that from the Godly there is no danger to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59001:169"/> the Sacrament, and conſequently that in Them, Frequecy is commendable, is not doubted: The only queſtion is concerning the Unworthy; but we oght alſo to conſider, that concerning Them is a counterqueſtion no leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</p>
               <p>For when we inquire on One ſide, Whether there be Danger, that the Sacrament may <hi>ſuffer diſhonor</hi> by ſuch mens <hi>Unworthineſs?</hi> it is worth inquiring, whether there be not SOM <hi>hope,</hi> that it may Gain Honor by their <hi>Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay [SOME] hope: For if there be Any <hi>ſuch Hope,</hi> however Short of <hi>ſuch Fear,</hi> in point of Probability; it will ſo exceed it in point of Valu, as abundantly to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh it's defect in Bulk. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The loſs of <hi>Many Sacraments</hi> will be abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by the gain of <hi>One Soul:</hi> Be the odds ſo great as in a Lottery; yet ſince One happy draught, will more than anſwer a Multitude of Blanks; eſpecially when there is nothing to be Loſt, but the labor of Drawing; it muſt needs more conduce to the honor of the Sacrament and its Author, to adventure upon the <hi>Smalleſt Hope</hi> That way; than to forbear upon the <hi>Greateſt Fear</hi> the Other way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Salvation of One</hi> impenitent ſinner is more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luabl than the <hi>cheriſhing of Many</hi> already converted. The good ſhepherd will leav <hi>ninety and nine</hi> to ſeek paſture, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſuffer <hi>one ſtrayer</hi> to periſh in the wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The odds in point of number lieth the other way: it wer a happier world than ever we ar like to ſee, if there wer but <hi>ninety and nine ſinners</hi> for <hi>one juſt perſon, that needs no repentance.</hi> Their very numbers wroght in our Lord compaſſion to the Multitude, and it wer ſtrange if he ſhould intend to let the greater part of mankind periſh for want of This food.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:59001:169"/>4. Here is no need to leav the Flock, for Salvation of the <hi>Strayer.</hi> Wer there not ſufficient for Both, we might perhaps plead it <hi>unfit to take the childrens bread and caſt it to Dogs:</hi> but the Lords tabl is as capabl to receve All comers, as was the wilderneſs to afford room for never ſo many thouſands; and the Bread is not like thoſe two <hi>courſ loaves,</hi> but like <hi>That which came from heaven,</hi> and covered the whole face of the earth: it hath both <hi>plenty and vertu</hi> ſufficient to anſwer All Palates, and All Needs, however different; no leſs Salutiferos to the <hi>Sick,</hi> then delicios to <hi>Healthy:</hi> and where there is enogh and to ſpare, it wer ſtrange our Lord ſhould intend any one ſhould periſh for hunger.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Here is no adventure, but of the troubl to <hi>Take and eat. The ſhepherd</hi> needs not toyl himſelf with Wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſt of the <hi>Loſt ſheep,</hi> nor with <hi>ſhouldering</hi> home the <hi>Found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord is not in danger to loſe any more Bloud; the greateſt loſs that can com, muſt fall upon That already ſpilt; which at worſt, takes no Life from our <hi>Lord,</hi> thogh it bring None to the <hi>Recever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No wounds or ſtripes can reach his Body, The greateſt danger is, leſt <hi>the ſhadow of his body paſſing by,</hi> ſhould (now as in his life-time) fall upon ſom Lepers and <hi>cleanſe</hi> them; without Hinderance to his Progreſs, or Prejudice to his Better diſciples.</p>
               <p>So that if there be any <hi>healing, ſaving</hi> vertu, in This other ſhadow of his body and bloud; to ſay he forbids Any to com within its reach, for <hi>This very reaſon</hi> bicauſ they Need it; is ſo farr from honoring him as a <hi>good Phyſician,</hi> that it repreſents him worſ than his very Accuſers, of whom he asked <hi>which of You</hi> (of <hi>You</hi> my envios backbiters) <hi>Which of You having one ſheep,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If therefor our <hi>Bleſſed Redeemer</hi> have any right to what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the Father, <hi>His honor is great in Our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:59001:170"/> his Diſhonor muſt be proportionably great, if he deny ſo cheap a means of it, as ſhall not coſt him the troubl of a Journy to ſeek, but only the Mercy to Admit ſuch as need it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. 2. SECONDLY, <hi>This Sacrament hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting vertu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, 'thogh it need no other proof, but only the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of That general rule, that <hi>In Religion That is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Trueſt which is Beſt;</hi> yet bicauſ ſuch a work cannot be overdo'n, I ſhall further prove it, 1. <hi>By the Authority of the Apoſtls:</hi> and 2. <hi>By Reaſon, ſhewing that Morally it muſt needs be ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider what the APOSTLS thoght of This Sacrament, we ſhall find, they look't upon it as a Spiritual <hi>Panacaea</hi> for All diſtempers of Chriſt's myſtical body: a rich Treaſure for All Arguments and All Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
               <p>When St. <hi>Jude</hi> would Character the worſt men, he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth his black from This Sacrament, if not from This Diſcourſ: <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ar ſpots in your Feſts of Charity while they feſt with you foeding themſelvs without fear.</hi> When the Epiſtler to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> would ſet forth the gilt of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> moſt graphically, he doth it <hi>by treading under foot the Son of God,</hi> and That, by <hi>counting this blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wherewith they were ſanctified an unholy thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In This Epiſtl St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth to affect this Topik up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions: When he would admoniſh them to <hi>put from among them</hi> the Scandalos perſon, <hi>Let us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>keep the feſt without leaven bicauſ Chriſt the Paſſover is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he would dehort them from fellowſhip with Idols, he argueth from the inconſiſtency of <hi>the Lords table and the table of devils:</hi> When he would exhort them to provide for the poor, he appointeth the firſt day for the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59001:170"/> Offertory, bicauſe conſecrated to the breaking of bread: and Here, when he would reprove them for their debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries in Gods houſ; to ſet forth the hainoſneſs of the crime, he proveth that thereby they becom <hi>gilty of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>when he would reprove them for their debaucheries in Gods houſ:</hi> for I muſt now add to what I have already ſaid, that as thoſe Debaucheries were the true Occaſion of the whole diſcourſ, ſo was the Lord's Supper employed as the beſt Argument, whereby to convince them of the hainoſneſs of That crime; that whatever thoghts they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have had, concerning ſuch Profaneneſs in Gods Houſ, they might by This new Argument underſtand it greater than they wer aware of.</p>
               <p>And what better argument could he have urged in ſuch a caſe? Should he have empleaded them at the Moral bar? He knew them proof againſt ſuch lectures of their own Philoſophers, ſtrenuoſly, but unproſperoſly declaming againſt them. Should he have pleaded Natural Religion? He knew that They and their Fathers had, time beyond memory, do'n the ſame in their Templs. Should he then urge the great difference in purity between the true God and Divels? This were proper, but remote; the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might be ſufficient Plain, but not ſufficiently Deep: it might convince their Reaſon, but not ſo powerfully move their Affections.</p>
               <p>But This intereſt of <hi>the body and bloud of Chriſt,</hi> as it was new and properly Evangelical, ſo was it utterly unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerabl upon any account, either of reaſon or cuſtom.</p>
               <p>And that it was upon This Occaſian and to This End urged, ſeemeth moſt plain from the very Text: For their <hi>Coming together</hi> is twice complained of, before the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is mentioned; and in the third place, This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed only as an Evidence of the Other: Whereas by the Laws of Reaſon and Cuſtom, if This had had the chief place in the Apoſtls intention, it muſt have had the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59001:171"/> ſame in his Diſcurſ; and not be'n put to wait behind, to com forth only as a valet to perform ſervice to it's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</p>
               <p>This is worthy more obſervation than the world is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of: For as the thing it ſelf is to a conſidering perſon very plain, ſo ar the conſequences very great; and That upon an account already caſt up.</p>
               <p>For if the Apoſtl make uſe of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as an aggravation of profaneneſs in <hi>Gods houſ,</hi> and That for This reaſon, bicauſ all the unworthineſs which we bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is imputed to us as broght to his table; then muſt it be the moſt potent argument that poſſibly can be draw'n, ether from Religion or Reaſon, to make us careful of our behavior in Gods houſ, and conſequently every where els; <hi>In Gods houſ,</hi> upon the Apoſtl's reaſon, bicauſ of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our Lords table, which poſſeſſeth the chiefeſt place there; and conſequently <hi>Every where els,</hi> bicauſ of the preparations which we muſt cary thither, and the good impreſſions which we muſt receve there, ſo much the deeper, by how much better our ſelf-examination hath prepared us.</p>
               <p>AND This very argument do we find uſed by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> to the ſame Purpoſe, and with the ſame Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his 252 Sermon <hi>de tempore,</hi> upon the Anniverſary of the Dedication of the Church or Altar. Beginning with the words of the Apoſtl, <hi>The templ of God is holy, which templ ye ar;</hi> for a proof how neceſſary it is, that we <hi>keep this Templ ſhut to the Devil, and open to Christ;</hi> he perſuadeth every one to examin his conſcience; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n This for an undoubted truth, <hi>Qui enim agnoſcens reatum ſuum, ipſe ſe humiliter ab Eccleſiae altari pro emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione vitae removere voluerit, ab aeterno illo &amp; coeleſti convivio excommunicari penitus non timebit.

                     </expan> potentis hominis nemo praeſumit cum veſtibus conſciſſis,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo goeth on throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Sermon, arguing againſt unworthy coming
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59001:171"/> to the Lords Supper in ſuch a ſtile, that I verily believ our divines take thence their confidence to write as they have do'n.</p>
               <p>I anſwer not for his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but I do for his <hi>Argument,</hi> as being the ſame with the Apoſtl's, as above urged. Nor could he have argued better for care of coming worthily to God's Houſ, than by urging the hainoſneſs of coming unworthily to his Table; ſeeing it was as true in His time, as in the Apoſtl's, that whoever came to the One, came alſo to the Other.</p>
               <p>But if we meſur his Argument by our own Cuſtoms, then will it be as weak, as the Suppoſition will be fals: For the Concluſion will exceed the Premiſes, and fall ſhort of the Fathers Deſign; ſince it will not fright any from unworthineſs in the Templ, but ſuch as intend to com alſo to the Altar, <hi>i. e.</hi> few or none.</p>
               <p>Yet will not this Inſufficiency be the worſt of its falts; it will be ſo far from prevailing with a profane man to quit his luſts, that it tends to harden him in them. For when ſuch a man ſhall hear ſo much ſpoken againſt <hi>unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating,</hi> and ſo littl, or nothing againſt <hi>unworthy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> how plauſibly may his willing mind infer, that there is as littl need for Him to fear the later, as for his teacher to warn him from it.</p>
               <p>I therefor offer it to moſt ſerios conſideration, whether the almoſt general looſneſs of this age, be not much inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, by the agreement tripartite which we ſeem impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely to have made, between <hi>Prayer, This Sacrament, and the World;</hi> whereby it is agreed, that <hi>Prayer ſhall enjoy Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency without Reverence; This Sacrament, Reverence</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Performance; <hi>The World, it's Luſts without Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from either of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas were Worthineſs preſſed in the now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed figure, with half the vigor that it is in the Vulgar; Were half of that which our Divines ſpeak, of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sacrament in the abſtract, applied to it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59001:172"/> with Common-Prayer: Did we believ our ſelvs to ly under the ſame Neceſſity and Conditions of worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Gods houſ, as we do for his Supper; then can we not doubt it neceſſary ſo to live, that we may be capabl to com worthily to <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> even for it's companion's ſake.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. NOR is there any reaſonable fear, leſt this ſhould have the ſame malignant aſpect upon the Whole, as we complain of in behalf of the Common-ſervice; leſt in-ſtead of bringing men to the Church with greater reverence, it ſhould drive them quite away from it. This danger is ſufficiently prevented by the Apoſtl's Indicative way of arguing, which telleth us that Chriſt imputeth guilt to us, not according to Our Performance, but his Own Inſtitution: and This imputation will reach us at Any diſtance, not only from his Table, but his Houſ too.</p>
               <p>For if it be no leſs our duty to com to God's houſ as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the congregation is held There; than it is to com to his Table as often as we com to his Houſ; and if God by his <hi>ſcientia media</hi> ſeeth and puniſheth the unworthineſs which we would have broght to his Table if we had com'n to it; Then to what diſtance ſoever we cary it, we ar by God reputed to have broght it both to his Houſ and his Table, as often as his Church meeteth at the One, and oght to do at the Other, bicauſ we oght to have met it at Both.</p>
               <p>What the Apoſtl ſaith in another caſe of himſelf, we may apply to our ſelvs in This, <hi>I verily as abſent in the body but preſent in the ſpirit, have already judged as preſent:</hi> and again, <hi>When you ar gathered together and My ſpirit.</hi> If the Acts of the Church might be authoriſed by the reputed ſuffrage of the Abſent Apoſtl, then may the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> be profaned by the reputed communication of the Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Abſent; ſince every member no leſs concurreth with the Church in Worſhip, than the Apoſtl did in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:59001:172"/>
               <p>And this is plainly enogh implyed in that practice of the then Church, which we heard teſtified by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> For ſending to the Abſent their parts of Communicated bread and wine, they thereby owned them to have the ſame intereſt, as if they had be'n preſent.</p>
               <p>This rock therefor followeth us as it did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, to what diſtance ſoever we eloin our ſelvs: He followeth us with imputation of Receving even when we Refuſe him, to condemn us if we receve him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhed hands; and to condemn us dubl, if we therefor refuſe him, bicauſ we will not be at the troubl to waſh them.</p>
               <p>The Neceſſity of the H. C. thus ſtated; Let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions of worthineſs, be multiplied and enforced with what rigor you pleaſe. Let them be more intolerabl, than plucking out Both eyes, and cutting off Both hands, ſo they be indiſpenſibl: No reaſonabl man will be thereby frighted from the Lords table, but every one will be ſo from his ſins, ſince he every where carieth about him the ſame guilt and danger, thogh he com not.</p>
               <p>Nor will the Scrupulos be at all diſtracted with doubts whether it be beſt to com or forbear, ſince this will be no other than to queſtion, whether it be beſt to be Singly or Dubly gilty. Singly, if he com with unworthineſs; or Dubly, if he diſhonor the Lords table, both by Forſake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Profaning it; the one in Reality, the other by Imputation.</p>
               <p>And this muſt needs be the opinion of the good Almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver above-praiſed, who would not ſuffer the peopl to go away without the Communion, but broght them back when they were already go'n out of the Church: an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, which he would never have uſed, had he not believed it more ſinful to Omit the duty, than to perform it, unprepared as they wer; whereof no better account can be given than this; that our obligation <hi>beſets us behind and before, and layeth ſuch hand upon us, that we cannot fly
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59001:173"/> from it's preſence;</hi> but muſt neceſſarily fly from our ſins, bicauſ this is the only way left us, to eſcape the judgments threatened to unworthy Communicants: and whether ſuch an ordinance be a converting one or no, I ſhall no further diſpute from Scripture: but proceed to conſider Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="5">V. REASON will perſuade that the Sacrament muſt be a converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p>He that will deny this, muſt impute the Defect, either to the Unfitneſs of our <hi>Lords Death,</hi> toward ſuch an effect, or 2. To the Inſufficiency of the Sacrament, to ſet it forth, or 3. To our <hi>Lords denial</hi> of his ordinary Bleſſing. In <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>All</hi> of Theſe, muſt the Defect needs ly; for if they <hi>All</hi> concurr, Nothing is wanting to a ſaving efficacy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The defect cannot ly in the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> which the Apoſtl ſo often tells us, he ſuffered to <hi>This</hi> very Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſpeaketh, I ſay not more <hi>Clearly,</hi> but (ſure) more <hi>Frequently,</hi> of his dying for our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> than for our <hi>Juſtification;</hi> to redeem us from the <hi>Works,</hi> than from the <hi>Wages of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it ſound ambiguoſly when the Apoſtl ſaith he died to <hi>redeem us from all iniquity,</hi> he cleareth it by an immediat explication, <hi>to purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar peopl zelos of good works.</hi> What can be ſpoken plainer than this, <hi>That he died to redeem us from our vain converſation;</hi> that he <hi>carried our ſins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to ſin might live to righteouſneſs; to leave us an exampl that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And had the Apoſtls be'n ſilent, plain Reaſon would have taught it us, For as in Law, <hi>without ſhedding of bloud there was no remiſſion;</hi> ſo was there no need of more, than the <hi>mere death</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> ſo much the <hi>fitter</hi> for That ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by how much more <hi>Pampered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then muſt our Lord be ſo unhappily unlike his typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oxen? why might he not have be'n ſacrificed like Them:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59001:173"/> by <hi>One blow</hi> and <hi>No pain;</hi> cloſing a Full and Eaſie Life, with a Death as Eaſie?</p>
               <p>What could the Law have expected from Him, beyond what the <hi>Jews</hi> expect in their <hi>Meſſiah the Son of David;</hi> a <hi>Life Victorios</hi> and <hi>glorios,</hi> cloſed with a <hi>Death ſuitably glorios</hi> in the <hi>Bed of honor? One Drop of bloud</hi> (perhaps) certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>ſingl Death,</hi> however <hi>Eaſie</hi> or <hi>Honorabl,</hi> of a Perſon of <hi>infinit valu;</hi> muſt in <hi>juſtice</hi> be ſufficient to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> ſo <hi>Willing</hi> to receve <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what purpoſe then All the <hi>(this way)</hi> Needleſs, and <hi>to him</hi> incomparably more Grievos, <hi>Other Sufferings?</hi> Why a <hi>Life ſo Poor, ſo Deſpiſed, ſo Hated, ſo Laborios?</hi> Why a <hi>Death ſo Painful, ſo Shameful, ſo Intolerabl?</hi> Why? but for the Apoſtl's reaſon; <hi>To leave us an exampl that we ſhould follow his ſteps?</hi> which as they ſhewed us the way, ſo did they ſmooth it for us; that no man might think much to <hi>take up his Croſs, and follow</hi> ſuch a Leader.</p>
               <p>SUCH a leader as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who did not ſay to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Go, but Com; make, them follow him, if not for Valor, yet for Shame: <hi>It became him who was to bring many Sons to Glory, to make the Captain of our Salvation perfect by ſufferings;</hi> and ſuch ſufferings too, that none of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſhall ever be able to upbraid him, as requiring More.</p>
               <p>To deny therefor that ſuch a Death is fit to Redeem us, both from the <hi>Service of ſin,</hi> and <hi>Fear of ſuffering;</hi> is to <hi>giv</hi> the Scripture the <hi>Ly,</hi> and to <hi>take</hi> from our Lords death it's <hi>Vertu.</hi>

By how much the Ey is tenderer than the Ear, by ſo much is the Mind more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it: Now This Sacrament ſetteth forth the Death of our Lord, not to the Ear as Preaching doth, but to the very Ey; and that not as a Picture but as a <hi>Drama:</hi> it ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorates, as to Act the Tragedy; ſo Deſcribes, as to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite it's Benefits.</p>
               <p>How much more potent ſuch <hi>viſibl Rhetorik</hi> is than the moſt powerful Preaching, <hi>Antony</hi> made a memorabl ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: He imployed all his Eloquence to ſtir up the peopl of <hi>Rome,</hi> to revenge the death of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> He magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Wiſdom, his Induſtry, and his Valor: he recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Victories, celebrated his Vertues, lamented the cruelty of his Death; Then he recited his Teſtament, and from the Legacies therein bequeathed, proved the greatneſs of his Love to them; in his life their Champion, after death their Benefactor. All this the peopl heard, thogh with Grief, yet with Patience: But when he produced his Robe, when he ſhewed the Holes and the Bloud, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the murdering Poniards had Pierced and Stained it; then did thoſe viſibl Orators, not only Move them to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but Tranſport them to Rage; they ſnatched up Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and Firebrands; and miſſing the Perſons, deſtroyed the Dwellings of the Conſpirators.</p>
               <p>Such is the <hi>Deſigne,</hi> ſuch the <hi>Rhetorik</hi> of This <hi>Sacrament.</hi> When the Word hath prepared the <hi>Heart</hi> by the <hi>Ear;</hi> when the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is <hi>Informed,</hi> and the <hi>Affections</hi> ſomewhat <hi>Moved,</hi> with the recital of <hi>What our Lord ſuffered,</hi> And
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59001:174"/> Why? Then doth the Sacrament complete the ſervice, by ſhewing to our very <hi>Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Wounds,</hi> not of his <hi>Garments</hi> but his <hi>Fleſh;</hi> and Thoſe, not as long ſince <hi>made,</hi> but as now in <hi>making,</hi> Repreſents his Sacred bloud, not as <hi>dried up</hi> by time, but as Now, even Now, ſtreaming from his <hi>Heart.</hi> It ſo <hi>Commemorates</hi> his paſſion, as to Repete it: and in the moſt <hi>inflaming</hi> manner preſents to our Souls, all thoſe incentives againſt ſin, which our <hi>Lords death,</hi> our <hi>Lords Preſent death,</hi> can furniſh.</p>
               <p>He that conſiders, how the little ſens of Religion yet left in the world, is derived from the <hi>Frequency</hi> of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> will find too great reaſon to bewail the invaluabl loſs it ſuffers, by want of ſo helpful an Attendant.</p>
               <p>For if That (maimed as it is) do in Som (however Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl) meſure, prevail by it's Singl and Deſerted ſtrength; how much more might we hope from their <hi>united Forces,</hi> if <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſecunded his <hi>Armor bearer!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay that we might Then ſing of them, as the daghters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of their victorios Princes, Preaching hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it's <hi>Thouſands,</hi> and the Sacrament it's <hi>Ten thouſands,</hi> would be but a cold Eulogy: We have no reaſon to doubt, that as there is more than <hi>Ten</hi> to <hi>One,</hi> difference in their <hi>Powers,</hi> ſo would there be in their <hi>Succeſſes:</hi> Unleſs we will needs doubt of our <hi>Lords ordinary bleſſing</hi> upon his ſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ordinance; which we have far more reaſon to believe, he would aſſiſt with the Spirit, not only of a <hi>David</hi> but a <hi>Samſon;</hi> as being a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> appropriat to himſelf. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, I ſhall ſay but this litle to ſuch a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: That as it would look almoſt like a <hi>Miracle,</hi> if an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Conſtant Communicant</hi> ſhould miſs a <hi>bleſſing;</hi> ſo we may be ſure, that if there needed a Miraculos Power to bleſs <hi>ſuch an one,</hi> it would not be <hi>wanting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is incredibl, that he who promiſed, that <hi>when ever two or three ar gathered together in his name, there he will be in the mids of them,</hi> ſhould not be moſt <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> and moſt
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59001:175"/> 
                  <hi>Gracioſly preſent</hi> with thoſe, who meet, not in his Name only, but at his Table, upon his Own kind invitation, to feſt, not With him only, but Upon him.</p>
               <p>Of this I ſay no more, bicauſ Thoſe whom I diſpute with, ar ſo far from denying our <hi>Lords eſpecial Preſence;</hi> that they make it the Reaſon for Their Abſence, who moſt need it, but how much they <hi>thereby honor our Lord</hi> and his <hi>Supper,</hi> let what I have above ſaid declare: for I haſten to my third poſition.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. 3. MY THIRD Poſition is, that the <hi>Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power</hi> of the Sacrament is better Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and it's Honor more Advanced, by Frequent, than by Seldom Celebrations.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is concerning the Greater or Leſs probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Converſion of a Sinner: whom we muſt ſuppoſe arrived to neither of the Oppoſit perfections; neither Worthy on the One ſide, nor Atheiſtical on the Other; but in a <hi>Midl ſtate;</hi> ſenſibl of his duty, both to our Lord and his Church; Willing (or rather Submitting) to do, what he ſhall be convinced to be required of him; but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering between his Obedience to our Lords Command, which ſeemeth to require Frequency at leaſt; and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtls indulgence,</hi> backed with appearance of Reaſon, which recommendeth <hi>Aw</hi> and <hi>Diſtance,</hi> as neceſſary to preſerv that Reverence, which it is ſuppoſed will beſt advance both the Honor of the Sacrament, and Benefit of the Recever.</p>
               <p>For ſuch an one may plead, that if I ow any perſon <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings,</hi> and pay him <hi>One Guinny,</hi> I do better, than if I paid him <hi>Twenty ſilver ſhillings:</hi> So if <hi>One Solen Addreſs,</hi> be more worth then <hi>Twenty</hi> of the <hi>Conſtant;</hi> it will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to com One time for Twenty, With ſuch <hi>Solennity,</hi> then Twenty times for One Without it: And conſequently, our Lord will accept of That, as more perfect obedience than This.</p>
               <p>At preſent we diſpute not, that in <hi>This Inſtitution,</hi> the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59001:175"/> 
                  <hi>Number</hi> of pieces is the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Obligation; but admit the ſuppoſed liberty of paying <hi>One Golden</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, in lieu of <hi>Many Leſs valuabl;</hi> and upon This Suppoſition, require that the Pretence may be made good: <hi>viz.</hi> That the One for Twenty may be Such, as ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence by the greater <hi>Valu,</hi> the defect in <hi>Number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>One Solen</hi> addreſs muſt have not only a <hi>plainer Stamp</hi> (as every new Coin may have) but <hi>purer Metal;</hi> not only more <hi>Outward Solennity,</hi> but more <hi>Inward Devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if a man <hi>bow the knee</hi> never ſo Solenly, and give the title of King never ſo Formally; yet if in So doing, he put no better then a <hi>Dry, Hollow, Light, Reeden Scepter</hi> into our Lords hand; he acteth more like a perſecuting <hi>Jew,</hi> than a Loyal <hi>Diſciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the preſent inquiry, Thoſe who ar to make the Addreſs ar ſuppoſed to ly in a ſtate of Enmity, and Need of Converſion, for concerning the Godly, there is no doubt, but the oftener the better.</p>
               <p>What ever <hi>Outward deference</hi> ſuch enemies bring, if it have nothing of the <hi>power of Godlineſs;</hi> it doth not honor our Lord with his <hi>Own Sceptre;</hi> For <hi>the Sceptre of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a right Sceptre, a love of Righteoſneſs, and hatred of iniquity:</hi> What ever wanteth This, wanteth That <hi>Divine life,</hi> without which the moſt <hi>Solen worſhip,</hi> is no better than a <hi>gay Pageant;</hi> who's Forced motions paſs for Solen, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bicauſ <hi>Unwieldy;</hi> the <hi>Abſence of inward life</hi> giving the Ly to them all.</p>
               <p>That we may the better Compare them, it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite we bring to vieu both the Rivals.</p>
               <p>And firſt let us bring forth that Shew, wherewith our Lord is to be better Served and Pleaſed, than with literal Obedience,</p>
               <p>WHEN the Unwelcom ſeaſon is now at hand, which Indiſpenſibly exacteth the painful task; the Unwilling vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary (if he can deſerv That name) finding No way to eſcape it, forceth himſelf to look Sadly upon his ſtill Beloved
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59001:176"/> ſins, Confineth himſelf for ſom tedios days, to the Lothed converſation of that Troublſom ſtranger, his Conſcience; wherewith he Communeth in ſuch Awkward manner, as plainly betrayeth his Unacquaintedneſs with it's language, not to be ſupplied by the vainly courted aſſiſtance of thoſe good Books, which at ſuch times only, he taketh the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to read; and after the appointed days, languiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in this heartleſs Exerciſe, which he calleth Preparation; he receveth (I ſay not the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> but) the <hi>holy Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols;</hi> with great Solennity (we grant) but with as little <hi>Benefit</hi> or <hi>Reliſh,</hi> as <hi>Appetite;</hi> and goeth home with This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort, that the Tedios work is do'n; and the <hi>Stately, Lifeleſs machin</hi> may be laid aſide, till the <hi>Revolution</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Solennity, call it forth to ſtalk abroad again, with the ſame Troubl, to the ſame <hi>Little purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let our adverſaries now deal freely; can they ſuppoſe ſuch Pageantry acceptabl to God? can ſuch Counters as have ſomthing of the due Image and Superſcription, but nothing of the due Metal; not only paſs for Current in the <hi>Kingdom of God;</hi> but bear a greater Valu, than ſuch pieces, as com out of his own Royal Mint? can God be pleaſed with ſuch performances as pleaſe not the <hi>Votary himſelf?</hi> can he be ſo much Better pleaſed with them, that One of them ſhall be reputed payment for Multiplied o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of Duty?</p>
               <p>Or (which is more pertinent to our preſent enquiry) can ſuch an exerciſe deſtroy the kingdom of the Devil in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing Soul? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I grant, Somthing hath be'n do'n toward it, The man hath be'n put in mind of his need of <hi>Chriſts bloud,</hi> and the Love that firſt Spilt it, and now Offered it; and This hath ſomwhat awakened the ſenſ of the Obligation he hath, to Lov and Serv him; which cannot but make <hi>ſom impreſſion</hi> upon his mind, which for <hi>ſom time,</hi> and in <hi>ſom meſure,</hi> may <hi>check</hi> his luſts, and <hi>quicken</hi> his care.</p>
               <p>All this I hope, and for <hi>This very reaſon</hi> complain, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59001:176"/> the <hi>good ſparks</hi> ſhould dy away; which by Repetition of the ſame exerciſe, might be <hi>blowen up</hi> to ſuch a vigoros Flame, as might wholly <hi>Deſtroy</hi> thoſe luſts, which ar now a littl <hi>Diſordered,</hi> but not <hi>Subdued:</hi> For the Litl that this hath do'n, is a ſufficient evidence how much <hi>More</hi> might be do'n; if ſo <hi>hopeful</hi> an exerciſe were duly <hi>Proſecuted</hi> with ſuch <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> as we have found <hi>required</hi> by <hi>our Lord;</hi> and comes now to be conſidered by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to its rival <hi>Solennity,</hi> and this we do by ſteps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Multiplied repetitions</hi> one time or other will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hit the mark. He who is miſſed by Many a Sermon, and Many a Communion, may happily be <hi>ſtruck</hi> to the heart by the Next.</p>
               <p>There was a time, when <hi>One Sermon</hi> converted <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,</hi> but miracles ar ceaſed; and now <hi>Many,</hi> perhaps <hi>Thouſands,</hi> of <hi>Sermons,</hi> ar neceſſary to convert <hi>One:</hi> Yet can we not charge <hi>God,</hi> as wanting to Neceſſary means, ſince the <hi>Miraculos efficacy</hi> is ſupplied by the <hi>Moral power</hi> of <hi>multiplied Repetition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Too many of thoſe who Separate Theſe ordinances in their <hi>Practice,</hi> do them the right to Join them in their <hi>Diſcourſes;</hi> pleading the ſame color of reaſon againſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency in <hi>Preachings</hi> and <hi>Communions;</hi> and thoſe who do Not, but will have Theſe rare for <hi>reverence</hi> ſake, and Thoſe frequent for their <hi>effects</hi> ſake; need no other evidence of the Weakneſs of their Objection againſt Frequence in the Communion, than its too <hi>great Strength;</hi> whereby it will caſt down what they would keep up; ſo that they ar redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to This choice, either that <hi>Preaching</hi> muſt be Leſs <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi> for fear of the <hi>Objection;</hi> or the <hi>Objection</hi> renegued, leſt <hi>Preaching</hi> ſhould be rob'd of <hi>Frequency,</hi> for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Objection</hi> is equally Deficient, ſo is <hi>Frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> equally Uſeful to Both. Who knoweth but That <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or That <hi>Communion</hi> which he is forſaking, may be
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59001:177"/> the critical One, which is to convert him?</p>
               <p>When an <hi>Affliction</hi> hath <hi>bruiſed,</hi> or a <hi>Bleſſing melted</hi> the heart; When the man hath <hi>Loſt a friend,</hi> or <hi>Eſcaped a danger,</hi> when <hi>a Neighbors</hi> unexpected <hi>death</hi> hath warned him of his <hi>Own frailty,</hi> or a <hi>good Angel</hi> hath unaccountably ſtirred the pool, and he is by ſom ſecret diſpoſition <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>We know not the ſecret walks of <hi>Gods providence,</hi> nor the advantages of <hi>Som ſeaſons</hi> above <hi>Others,</hi> by influences imperceptibl: that therefor we may not miſs the <hi>Proper,</hi> but <hi>

               <p>He that truly conſiders the <hi>valu of Salvation,</hi> and his own <hi>need</hi> of it; will not think much to ly <hi>in the way that Jeſus of Nazareth Paſſeth by;</hi> or rather, wherein he <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> on purpoſe, to <hi>heal</hi> and <hi>ſave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Repetition</hi> both Preſerveth the otherwiſe decaying Power of <hi>former</hi> acts, and addeth new of its own.

               <p>Nether <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> nor <hi>Affinity</hi> wer ſufficient to Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Heal a breach between <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> thogh Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle and Nephew by Bloud, Father and Son by Mariage: But when That Quarel ended in a <hi>Govenant</hi> of kindneſs; a <hi>Feſt</hi> ſealed it, as more obliging than Both Thoſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:59001:179"/>
               <p>Yea even <hi>Paternal affection,</hi> when it would exalt it ſelf to the Higheſt poſſibl rapture, caled in the aſſiſtance of This endearment. <hi>Take me ſom veniſon</hi> (ſaid <hi>Iſaac</hi> to his Firſtborn) <hi>and make me ſavory meat, ſuch I love, that I may eat [that my ſoul may bleſs thee.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The veniſon was not only to ſtrengthen his body, but heigthen his mind; the Feſt made a new relation, Hoſt and Gueſt, ſignified ſomthing of addition to Father and Son, and improved his title to Bleſſing. From this <hi>Jus Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitii</hi> was derived the <hi>Rite of Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God <hi>accepted</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> he ſignified his <hi>Love</hi> to the <hi>Votary,</hi> firſt by ſom Other tokens, (as appears by the ſtory of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>) and then by Entertening him at his Table.</p>
               <p>For God was the <hi>Houſ-keeper;</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> his <hi>Table;</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> his <hi>Meat;</hi> and the <hi>Votary,</hi> his <hi>Gueſt:</hi> Feſted with <hi>That Fleſh,</hi> whoſe propriety he had now Transferred to his God; and again Receved from him, in token of Communion.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be plainer than this from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>The ſame Perſons,</hi> by the <hi>Same Ceremonies,</hi> in the 20 <hi>verſ. Offer Sacrifice to Devils;</hi> and in 21. <hi>drink the cup of Devils, ar par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the table of Devils, and have fellowſhip with Devils;</hi> and all this, as their Gueſts, treated by their Gods, with the Sacrifices, themſelvs had offered to them.</p>
               <p>Upon This account have we found <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the beſt of his treatiſes, prove the mirth of the Religios, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend that of the <hi>Epicurean;</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> preferr that of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> above that of a <hi>Heathen:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What behavior becoms a <hi>Gueſt</hi> at This table of the Lord, if we underſtand not by what we have already ſaid; let us learn by exampl. The <hi>Apoſtls and their fellow commoners eat it with chearfulneſs:</hi> the next and all ſucceeding ages, ſtile it the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> Our Own Church ſaith it was <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for a thankful remembrance of the death of Christ, and of the benefits which we receve thereby.</hi>

               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:59001:179"/>
               <p>How joyful an exerciſe <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> is, he that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not, may learn of <hi>David. My mouth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be filled with marrow and fatneſs when my heart praiſeth thee with joyful lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is generally believed that the Pleaſure of <hi>Drinking</hi> is greater than that of <hi>Eating,</hi> and to this St. <hi>Paul</hi> inviteth us, ſaying <hi>Be not drunk with wine wherein is exceſs, but be ye filled with the Spirit, ſinging and making melody in your hearts to the Lord, giving thanks,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Meat indeed,</hi> and <hi>Drink indeed,</hi> and <hi>Fellowſhip indeed,</hi> and the moſt <hi>intimate Union;</hi> Whether we look to the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificance of <hi>Feſting</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> or the Deſign of <hi>This</hi> in <hi>Particular;</hi> Whether we regard the Exampl or Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Apoſtls,</hi> the Authority of the <hi>Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> or our <hi>Own in Particular;</hi> which way ſoever we look, we muſt expect a <hi>Deſert</hi> ſuitabl to the other proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>The fruits of the Spirit</hi> muſt attend the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> and what Thoſe ar, the Apoſtl tells us: <hi>The fruits of the ſpirit ar Love, Joy, Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefor in ſtead of Theſe, we ar treated with Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſuch as in ſtead of ſetting our <hi>hearts</hi> on <hi>praiſing God,</hi> ſhall ſet <hi>our teeth on edge;</hi> whatever thanks we owe to the <hi>Lord of the Table;</hi> there can be litl due to the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> either from <hi>Lord or Gueſts.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For they ſo <hi>ſet forth his ſufferings,</hi> as to repete them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Gueſts.

               </p>
               <p>We may go farther, and ſay that as they ar partakers of <hi>Christ's ſufferings,</hi> ſo ar they of his <hi>enemies curſes</hi> too. For this <hi>their table is made a ſnare to take themſelvs withall; and that which ſhould have be'n for their wealth, is to them an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of falling;</hi> which will be the more applicable to our unhappy <hi>Communicants,</hi> if our excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> miſtake not; who interprets the <hi>[Table]</hi> in that place, to ſignify the <hi>Sacrificial;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the <hi>votaries portion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For how is This Beatifik <hi>Wine</hi> mingled with <hi>Vinegre!</hi> This <hi>Bread</hi> with <hi>Gall!</hi> How is This Joyful <hi>Table made a Snare,</hi> to <hi>Catch, Intangle,</hi> and <hi>Gripe,</hi> the moſt worthy gueſts! And how doth the tenderneſs of conſcience give deeper reception to the Snare, and acuter ſens to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p>How few ar they, that upon the required Examination, find in themſelvs a <hi>full Aſſurance,</hi> that if they Dy at the Table, they ſhall be Saved! And how muſt <hi>All others</hi> (however worthy) be tormented, between <hi>hunger and thirſt</hi> after the <hi>Fleſh and Bloud of Chriſt,</hi> on the One ſide, and fear to be <hi>poiſoned</hi> by them, on the Other! On the One ſide, by fear of <hi>Eating and Drinking damnation,</hi> if they com in That ſtate of (doubted) <hi>unworthineſs;</hi> and on the Other, of <hi>deſerving</hi> it, if they omit a <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay a <hi>[Duty.]</hi> and every true Lover of our Lord ſaith the ſame. For whatever <hi>Latitude</hi> the <hi>diſputed words</hi> may be ſtretch'd to; they know, our <hi>Lord</hi> did not So <hi>Inſtitute</hi> and <hi>Recommend</hi> his Supper, only to be <hi>Neglected:</hi> But, if he required <hi>Conſtancy;</hi> then is every Omiſſion, a Sin by
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59001:180"/> 
                  <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to his <hi>Law:</hi> If Not, then it is (if poſſibl) a <hi>greater</hi> one againſt <hi>Greater</hi> obligations of love.</p>
               <p>For to a Loving, Generous Soul, a <hi>Trust</hi> is a <hi>Greater Obligation,</hi> than a <hi>Command:</hi> and <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> will pay More, than is Due.</p>
               <p>And then, further conſidering the <hi>work</hi> it ſelf, and it's <hi>fruits;</hi> they conclude <hi>Conſtancy</hi> to be Due, if not to our <hi>Lords Inſtitution,</hi> yet to their <hi>own Intereſts;</hi> which <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts</hi> reciprocally comprehend our <hi>Lords honor:</hi> ſince they cannot neglect his Bleſſings, offered in <hi>This Sacrament,</hi> without contemt to <hi>That bloud,</hi> which Once ſo dearly <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,</hi> and Still ſo kindly <hi>Offers</hi> them.</p>
               <p>In theſe things no Divine is ſilent. All Concurr in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the <hi>Bleſſings;</hi> and by Encoraging, Oblige every one that <hi>loveth</hi> our <hi>Lords Perſon,</hi> or deſireth his Grace, to lay hold upon <hi>Every opportunity</hi> to Worſhip the One, and Enjoy the Other.</p>
               <p n="3">III. BUT when on the Other ſide, we ar told that the <hi>Lord</hi> is no leſs <hi>preſent</hi> as a Judge than as an Hoſt: no leſs ready to Condemn the <hi>Unworthy,</hi> than to Bleſs the <hi>Worthy:</hi> And that Thoſe ar <hi>Unworthy,</hi> who com in any other ſtate of Soul, than they may ſafely <hi>dy in:</hi> They now need be, not only very Good, but very Bold, that ſhall dare to com upon ſuch Dangeros terms:</p>
               <p>For if the Perſon be never ſo <hi>Worthy,</hi> never ſo <hi>Safe;</hi> yet unleſs his Salvation be as Certain to Himſelf, as it is with God; he may not preſume to com, bicauſ he cannot bring with him a full aſſurance; and every <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> will put him at the <hi>ſame diſtance,</hi> as <hi>real Unworthineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YET ſeeing ſuch perſons have <hi>Hopes</hi> mingled with <hi>Fears;</hi> thogh they have no <hi>full Aſſurance</hi> that they ar Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, they have a <hi>good meſur</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> that they may be ſo; Theſe very <hi>Hopes</hi> beget <hi>Fears,</hi> that if they ſhould For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the <hi>Lords ſupper,</hi> they ſhould diſobey his commands, Bicauſe they have Doubts of their Worthineſs, they dare
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59001:181"/> not Com, leſt they ſhould com <hi>unworthily;</hi> and bicauſ they have <hi>Hopes,</hi> they dare not Forbear, leſt they ſhould omit a Duty, by forbearing cauſleſly: So they ſee danger on ether hand; they dare nether Com nor Forbear, leſt they ſhould do, ether the One or the Other <hi>unworthily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So their very piety and hopes of Salvation (thereupon bilt) which ſhould be their greateſt joy, is to Them an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of falling into a moſt griping Snare, which hath no hold upon ſuch as have nether hopes nor fears.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider by what motives the Generality ar (Led ſhall I ſay? no, it is <hi>the Goodneſs of God that Leadeth,</hi> but) <hi>Haled</hi> to <hi>repentance;</hi> even by chains of fear forged in Hell fire,</p>
               <p>Since thoſe who ar <hi>moſt Religios</hi> upon <hi>fear of damnation,</hi> muſt needs be <hi>moſt timoros:</hi> where can we hope to find (I ſay not That <hi>Family,</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> but) That <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that can ſhew us the ſcant number <hi>Three</hi> (which we have found Neceſſary to make up a <hi>Communion</hi>) who can com with Confidence?</p>
               <p>And what then ſhall That rare <hi>Phoenix</hi> do, which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither <hi>Worthineſs,</hi> nor <hi>Confidence,</hi> muſt want <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I plead not now the danger of <hi>Solitude</hi> to the <hi>Table,</hi> but That of <hi>Torment</hi> to the <hi>Communicant: God be</hi> bleſſed, ſom ar ſo Heroically pios, as to truſt their <hi>Saviors Goodneſs,</hi> notwithſtanding their <hi>Teachers Rigors,</hi> or their <hi>Own Fears;</hi> hoping their <hi>good intentions</hi> ſhall be Accepted, and their <hi>unworthineſs pardoned,</hi> if they com with <hi>Honeſt,</hi> thogh <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> hearts.</p>
               <p>But upon every turn of the Wind, what Storms ar ſuch good ſouls <hi>toſſed</hi> with! When they look <hi>backward,</hi> how do they fear leſt they may <hi>have receved unworthily!</hi> When they look <hi>forward,</hi> how do they fear leſt they <hi>ſhould do ſo</hi> again, if they <hi>com;</hi> or as bad, if they <hi>forbear!</hi> How <hi>earneſtly</hi> do they Labor both for ſuch <hi>Worthineſs,</hi> as they ar told is Neceſſary to avoid <hi>guilt;</hi> and for ſuch <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59001:181"/> it, as may make them no leſs <hi>Quiet</hi> than <hi>Safe!</hi> How often doth the very <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> of the <hi>later,</hi> hinder them from <hi>obteining</hi> it! And how much ſtill do their <hi>flutterings intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> them!</p>
               <p>How often doth this <hi>wreſtling</hi> with the <hi>heart,</hi> inrage the <hi>ſpleen!</hi> how often is the <hi>bloud ſharpened</hi> by this contending againſt it's <hi>cooruptions!</hi> How often doth earneſtneſs after <hi>Aſſurance</hi> kindl earneſtneſs in <hi>Others paſſions,</hi> and then how rigidly is This very <hi>effect</hi> of laboring for <hi>worthineſs,</hi> cenſured as a ſymptom of <hi>unworthineſs!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know an <hi>excellent Lady,</hi> troubled upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; that none of the meaneſt of our Divines (to ſay no more now) preſcribed This, as One rule of <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory examination,</hi> that we examin the <hi>irregularity of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> diſſuading us from the <hi>Next communion,</hi> if we find not our ſelvs to have gotten ground of them ſince the <hi>Laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And doth not the Snare finely encircle us? Our <hi>very Indeavors</hi> after worthineſs, the more Eagre they ar, the more they <hi>ſharpen our Bloud,</hi> and conſequently our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and make us more <hi>Unworthy;</hi> and This <hi>ſens of Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> obligeth us to <hi>Contend</hi> with all poſſibl <hi>Earneſtneſs,</hi> to maſter thoſe <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which by That <hi>very Contention,</hi> ar Strengthened:</p>
               <p>We now need no leſs help of the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> to ſweeten our Bloud; than of the <hi>Divine,</hi> to comfort our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and if the <hi>goodneſs of God</hi> help us not more than Both; we muſt either live Excommunicate from the <hi>Lords table,</hi> or Indanger our ſouls, by <hi>approaching</hi> it: And Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, muſt be Griped with <hi>endleſs fears,</hi> as having ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Omitted the greateſt <hi>duty of Love,</hi> or Performed it <hi>Unworthily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all this is ſo <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the very <hi>nature of a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> ſo <hi>contrary</hi> to the gracios <hi>purpoſes of our Lord,</hi> and ſentiments of <hi>beſt Chriſtians;</hi> that I am almoſt perſuaded to ſay, that <hi>Such preparation</hi> diſhonoreth the Holy table as much as <hi>None.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:59001:182"/>
               <p>The <hi>Mourning weed</hi> (ſure) is no leſs unfit for a <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment,</hi> than the <hi>Souldiers Buff,</hi> or the <hi>Laborers Ruſſet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is tru, our Lord will never <hi>interrogate ſuch gueſts,</hi> as did the <hi>King in the parable, Friend how cameſt thou in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not having a wedding garment!</hi> Himſelf knoweth, that the very <hi>Uneaſineſs of the garment</hi> is abundant evidence, that their Affections ar as Honeſt as Unſuitabl, and their <hi>welcom</hi> ſhall be ſuited to their <hi>Intentions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatever Reward they ſhall receve <hi>hereafter,</hi> it is manifeſt that at Preſent they ſuffer More, and more Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos perplexities, from This which oght to be the <hi>most pleaſant;</hi> than from <hi>All</hi> other the <hi>moſt mortifying</hi> duties.</p>
               <p>For in thoſe, the greateſt <hi>auſterities</hi> ar ſweetened by the <hi>pleaſures of the ſpirit,</hi> feſting their <hi>conſciences</hi> with this <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> that they ar doing <hi>Gods work;</hi> whereas in This, they ar not only rob'd of That Satisfaction, which is More properly <hi>due to it,</hi> but griped with Anxieties as <hi>intolerable</hi> as <hi>undue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which yet to Souls as <hi>conſiderative</hi> as <hi>pios,</hi> is leſs Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; than the Scandal thence ariſing, firſt to the Holy <hi>Table,</hi> and thence to <hi>Religion</hi> in general. For it muſt add Shame to Grief, when they ſee the <hi>beſt Arguments for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> that preſent Happineſs can offer, retorted <hi>againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No greater joy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plut.) than that of Religios fests, wherein the Epicurean hath no part.</hi> No <hi>greater,</hi> nor <hi>more</hi> numeros troubles (ſaith our experience) than thoſe which torment the <hi>Communicant,</hi> wherein thoſe who <hi>forbear</hi> have no part.</p>
               <p>For the moſt <hi>worthy Communicant</hi> may be perplexed with fears, that he is one of the <hi>unworthy,</hi> againſt whom St. <hi>Paul's threatnings</hi> ar leveled; but he that <hi>abſenteth</hi> himſelf, keepeth the ſame diſtance, both from <hi>That danger,</hi> and the <hi>troubl</hi> of <hi>preparation,</hi> as from the <hi>Table:</hi> For as is the <hi>Danger,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Fear</hi> of it, <hi>Great,</hi> but Condicional:</p>

                  <hi>Condicional,</hi> it cannot reach Others, who's <hi>neglect</hi> keeps them out of its ſphaere of activity.</p>
               <p>True: upon the <hi>whole complex,</hi> the <hi>Religios mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is incomparably kinder, even in its <hi>fears,</hi> than that of the <hi>Irreligios,</hi> even in his <hi>jollities;</hi> but we now conſider them, not in relation to our <hi>Lords Throne,</hi> but his <hi>Table:</hi> And in This Preciſe reſpect, we think it plain, that as This duty is ſtated, it muſt needs cauſe <hi>Great</hi> troubl to the One, and <hi>None</hi> to the Other.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Irreligios</hi> will therefor be free from <hi>any Troubl</hi> from it, if he <hi>Forbear;</hi> bicauſe he believeth himſelf ſo from any <hi>Obligation</hi> to Com: But the <hi>Religios,</hi> whether he Com or Forbear, will hardly eſcape <hi>Diſquiets,</hi> ſo much the more Grievos, by how much the Duty is more <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I.</hi> Feſting a bond of kindneſs among gueſts. Salt an embleme of Love. <hi>II.</hi> This a Feſt of Charity, ſeaſoned with a kiſs of Charity. The higheſt Communion. Drinking and Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Drinking healths. The Bride-cake. The Apoſtl's way of Arguing our Union from this Communion. <hi>III.</hi> The kiſs of charity tranſlated kiſſing the <hi>Pax, Panis benedictus,</hi> a mockery. The Sacrament not only diſabled from advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Love, but turned to a makebate, <hi>1.</hi> by taking away the neceſſity of the Supper, we take away its power to make us One body. Our Saviors precept of being reconciled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we offer our gift, miſerably perverted. <hi>IV. 2.</hi> By our too great aw, we not only diſable the Sacrament from healing the least breach, but make it an instrument of the greateſt. <hi>1.</hi> This multiplieth queſtions. <hi>2.</hi> Invenometh them. <hi>3.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them incurable. <hi>V.</hi> Taketh away the very ſubject of the queſtion: better the Sacrament had never be'n inſtituted than ſo abuſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Third good end to which the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is directed, is the <hi>cementing of All Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans together in Mutual Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Feſtival board is a Corporation: the Communion holdeth, not only between Head and Members, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Member and Member too.</p>
               <p>And it is Such, that our Lord reckoneth it among the Pretences, that ſhall be made to his favor at the great day. <hi>Many ſhall ſay at That day Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and drunk,</hi> [IN THY PRESENCE] We ſee he
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59001:183"/> reckoneth <hi>Eating and drinking [in his Preſence]</hi> 'thogh not at his Own table (for he made few feſts, but accepted of many) worthy to be ranked with <hi>Prophecying and doing many wonderful works in his Name,</hi> as an equal token of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, receved or deſerved.</p>
               <p>Salt was by Gods Law required in Every Sacrifice, and is ſo by Univerſal Tradition, in Every Feſt: We ſtartl at the ſpilling of it, as an unhappy omen: The reaſon given by ſom, is that it is the embleme of Love, and it is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by our Lord, ſaying <hi>Have Salt</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>among your ſelvs, and have Peace one with another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. THIS uniting vertu is more conſpicuous in our Lords Supper, than in Any Other; and the Apoſtls ſeaſoned it accordingly. <hi>Greet one another with [an holy kiſs]</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul:</hi> with <hi>[a kiſs of Charity]</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And the later ſeemeth to fit the Salt to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, in Name as well as in Nature. St. <hi>Jude</hi> caleth the Supper <hi>[a feſt of Charity]</hi> The kiſs therefor wherewith it muſt be ſeaſoned, might very properly be ſtiled <hi>[a kiſs of charity]</hi> That, was the ſtrongeſt Engagement; and This, the propereſt Seal. That, the Table; This, the Salt.</p>
               <p>The firſt time we find the Holy Supper celebrated, we find it deſerv the name which it afterward obteined: Well might it be caled a <hi>[Communion]</hi> for it was the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that ever the world admired, Act. 2.44. <hi>All that believed wer together, and had all things common, and ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d them to all men as every man had need, and continuing daily in the Templ, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread in the common houſ</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>partook the noriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with gladneſs and ſinglneſs of heart, praiſing God and having favor with all the peopl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that we may not imagin thoſe two Communions, of Goods, and of the Lords Supper, to be fortuitoſly met; the Apoſtl expreſly telleth us, that the One was the cauſ of the Other: <hi>We being Many ar One Bread and One Body</hi> [For] <hi>we ar all partakers of That One Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:59001:184"/>
               <p>It might upon too frequent occaſions appear conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that he putteth an emphaſis upon the Univerſality, both in the Reaſon and the Conſequence. <hi>[All] ar One Body,</hi> bicauſe <hi>[All] ar Partakers of That</hi> One <hi>Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might further obſerv (from <hi>J. Martyr</hi>'s teſtimony) how upon This account, the Primitive Chriſtians commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated even with the Abſent, by ſending them portions of the holy Supper, as ſymbols of their intereſt, both in the Feſt and their Love.</p>
               <p>And I might hence not improbably derive our own cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, of drinking to the Preſent and the Abſent, as a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of Love to Both: A notion ſo much the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibl, bicauſe (after the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> mode) we have made the Cup aequivalent to a whole Feſt.</p>
               <p>And among Us, to drink to any perſon, is ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a pledg of kindneſs, that it paſſeth in Law for a Releaſ, if pleaded to an action of Scandal or perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: and he that drinks the ſo offered cup, is ſaid to PLEDGE him that began it: <hi>i. e.</hi> he accepteth, and reciprocateth, or continueth on, that Pledge of love.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> the Solemnities of Marriage ar cloſed with this ceremony: The <hi>Prieſt</hi> bleſſeth a cup of wine, and <hi>Bridegroom</hi> and <hi>Bride</hi> both drink of it.</p>
               <p>And as in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> the holy ſymbols were caried to the Abſent, ſo do we communicate our pledge of Kindneſs to our Abſent friends, by communicating it to them, and ſomtimes by drinking their healths; which can have no worſ meaning, than a declaration of our good wiſhes to them, and an intention to communicate to them all that kindneſs which a Feſt can ſignify or exerciſe.</p>
               <p>But ſince the <hi>Apoſtl</hi> draweth not his Argument from the Cup, but the Bread; it will be fitter for us to take notice, that Thence alſo ar drawen obligations to mutual Kindneſs. <hi>Companions,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ar ſuch as eat of the Same Bread. And <hi>David</hi>'s complaint that <hi>he that eat of his bread had laid wait for him,</hi> was not grounded upon the unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59001:184"/> of the beneficiary, as one whom he had nuriſhed with his bounty; ſo much as the incivility of his <hi>[Companion]</hi> that had familiarly converſed with him at the ſame table.</p>
               <p>Nor ar we ſhort of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in our Bridall ceremony: For our <hi>Bride-cake</hi> anſwereth their <hi>Bride-cup:</hi> with this advantage, that when the New-married cople have firſt taken their parts, the reſt is communicated to other friends, in pledge of a common affection among the whole Company.</p>
               <p>But no Cuſtom, Ancient or Modern, is ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as the <hi>Apoſtl's</hi> way of Arguing. He doth not urge it as Probabl, but Contingent; Apt to produce the effect, but Capabl to be diſappointed; Doth not ſay, It is Fit, or it is Intended; we May, or Oght to be made One by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we [Are] and For this Reaſon we [Are One] Both the Effect, and the Reaſon are Actually exiſtent, and ſo, ſecure not to be hindered from being.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kiſs of Charity</hi> was as certain an attendant upon This holy feſt, as the Feſt it ſelf was upon Every holy meeting. The Communicants parted with the moſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Kiſſes, the moſt Endearing Embraces, and all other expreſſions of moſt Ardent Love: All this conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeted at every meeting, ſtill feweled their mutual love, and kept the divine fire alive, as did the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, That upon Gods holy Altar.</p>
               <p>Such was the Significancy, ſuch the Efficacy of This holy feſt. As nothing could be more Proper, ſo nothing could be more Proſperos. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaid the Perſecutors) <hi>how the Chriſtians love one another! And behold</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtl) <hi>the Reaſon why they do ſo! It is bicauſ they eat of That</hi> One Bread, <hi>That</hi> Feſt of Charity, <hi>ſeaſoned with the</hi> holy Kiſs of Charity.</p>
               <p n="3">III. BUT how miſerably in our days is the <hi>Oſculum Pacis</hi> tranſlated into <hi>Kiſſing of the Pax!</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively, the Kiſs was begun by the Prieſt, and caried on
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59001:185"/> throgh the aſſembly; Now, the Prieſt delivereth ſom paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toy, to be kiſſed by the peopl; and no other kiſs thoght on.</p>
               <p>And for the Bread, what a fine trick do both <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches agree in, to mock its Charitifik vertu! They take a loaf, half conſecrate it, diſtribute it among the peopl, but not at the holy Tabl, and every one carieth his morſel to his ſeveral home, where he ſomtimes Eats and ofterner Keeps it: Is not this to mock the Apoſtl? All ar perhaps partakers of That One bread; but ſo, as Not to be made One body: For they do not ſo properly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, as Diſperſ it; render it rather an Embleme of Separation, than of Union; not of One Body, but Many ſcattered Particles.</p>
               <p>So we <hi>greet</hi> not <hi>one another</hi> (as the Apoſtl preſcribeth) <hi>with a kiſs of charity,</hi> but the Picture which we have made of the Lords Supper, with a kiſs of veneration; and That Picture no more like the life, than the Modern kiſs is like the Primitive: and the whole vertu is loſt with all tokens of its uniting power. And would to God it wer no worſ than loſt.</p>
               <p>Our abuſe doth not only falſify the unhappy Propoſition, but Convert it with that worſt kind of Converſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We [Cannot be] one Body, bicauſe we [Cannot eat] that One Bread:</hi> A converſion too properly <hi>per Impoſſibile;</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our many and irreconcileable contentions, make That Impoſſibl to Us, which to the Apoſtl ſeemed Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Neceſſary, by reaſon of This very bread: It is not a Feſt of charity, but an Apple of Contention; in ſtead of <hi>kiſſing,</hi> we <hi>bite</hi> one another, and turn the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker to an Incendiary.</p>
               <p>Litl did the <hi>Apoſtl</hi> think of this holy Banket, when he ſaid, <hi>Mark thoſe which cauſe diviſions among you, and Avoid them.</hi> Yet this dubl plaint do we now put up againſt the Modern way of honoring it: It firſt makes It to cauſe diviſion, and then cauſeth Us to avoid it.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:59001:185"/>
                  <item>1. <hi>By taking away the Obligation to Eat this Bread, we diſable it from making us One Body,</hi> and ſo deprive it of the Bleſſing of a Peace-maker.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>By too ſuperſtitios fear of it, we not only diſable it from heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Leaſt breach, but make it an Inſtrument of the Greateſt:</hi> and ſo make it a Curſ inſtead of a Bleſſing.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By taking from our ſelvs the Obligation to Eat This Bread, we take from it, the Power to make us One Body.</hi> This is as clear, as That common Axiom, <hi>Sublata cauſa tollitur effectus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot (ſure) doubt but our Gracios Lord deſigned as great Vertu to his Own table, as to the Legal Altar; which by a Plain (thogh Suppoſitive) Precept, he preferred to the Power of a Peace-maker; ſaying, <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembereſt that thy brother hath oght againſt thee; leav there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then com and offer thy gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by our miſapplication of the Suppoſitive Command, we have utterly defeated the deſign of the Precept.</p>
               <p>The Method we like well enogh, <hi>Firſt to be reconciled, and Then to com;</hi> and think we obey it ſufficiently, if This be the Laſt action of our life; and That, the laſt, ſave This One: Quite contrary to our Lords Precept, who for avoiding delay, bids us, not cary back our gift, but <hi>leave it before the Altar,</hi> as an earneſt of our ſpeedy return; which we cunningly eſcape, by not coming thither at all.</p>
               <p>We agree (indeed) with the beſt ages in the Antecedent, <hi>That none but the charitable muſt communicate;</hi> but we thence infer concluſions directly oppoſit. For They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Poſitively: <hi>Therefore I muſt be reconciled, that I may communicate:</hi> but We, Negatively: <hi>Therefor I will Not Communicate, bicauſe I will Not be Reconciled:</hi> They There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for thoght Charity Neceſſary, bicauſe they thoght the Communion ſo: and We taking away the Neceſſity of Communicating, take away all its influence upon Charity.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:59001:186"/>
               <p>When therefor we conſider the vaſt difference between the Preſent, and Primitive ages, in point of Charity; whatever cauſe we have to Lament, we have none to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, unleſs we look upon it's Cauſe. For our neglect of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> may well challenge our wonder; but that This ſhould beget it's genuine iſſu, is no wonder at all.</p>
               <p>If it be pleaded, that our forbearance proceeds not from Neglect, but Reverence; This will give cauſe of a yet greater complaint; for ſuch is our Second, <hi>viz.</hi> that</p>
               <p n="4">IV. 2. <hi>BY our too ſuperſtitios fear of This Bread, we not only diſable it from healing the Leaſt breach, but make it an Inſtrument of the Greateſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is but juſt, that if we commute Obedience for Reverence, we ſhould make the Compenſation as great as the Loſs; or at leaſt, we ſhould do our utmoſt, to make it ſo; firſt by Thinking and Speaking moſt honorably; and then, by valuing our Opinions in proportion to our Eſteem of the Subject.</p>
               <p>While therefor Som (in complyance with the Former) ſay more than Others can Believ or Comprehend; and then (in conformity with the Later) think themſelvs obliged to do their utmoſt, to bring All men to their own Sentiments; what conſequence can be more natural than this, that there be More, and more Aigre contentions about This, than Any other Subject; which cannot ether ſo much confound our Judgments, by it's Myſterioſneſs, or engage our Zele, by it's Worth.</p>
               <p>What Reaſon would thus perſuade us to expect, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence compelleth us to ſee and bewail.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This multiplieth queſtions. Our too much fear maketh us therefor ſcrupulos in every Litl thing, bicauſe the Greatneſs of the Subject maketh nothing ſeem Litl.</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:59001:186"/>
               <p>Whether the Bread muſt be Leavened or Unleavened, who would have imagined worth diſputing? yet was it thoght not only worth a Diſpute, but a Quarrel; and that nether ſmall nor ſhort, but Fierce, and for ſeveral centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of years, between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches. Whether the Table ſtand Eaſt and Weſt, or North and South, who would have thoght worth a contention? and who would think the poſture of the Communicant, leſs inconſiderable than That of the Table? Yet ar Thoſe made maters, not only of Contention, but of Schiſm. In Other offices of publik worſhip, who thinks himſelf a Judge ether of Prieſt or Peopl? but many ſcruple to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceve the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> ether From an unworthy Miniſter, or With an unworthy Communicant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As it multiplieth queſtions, ſo doth invenom them; turns Queſtions to Quarrels; and thoſe Fierce, perhaps Bloudy. What lamentable effects have we heard, ſeen, and felt, of mens zele, more heated in This, than in Any Other Fornace! Concerning <hi>Tranſubſtantion</hi> and <hi>Single-communion,</hi> between <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Reformed:</hi> Concerning <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> between <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Poſtures</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> between <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Separiſts</hi> among our ſelvs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it maketh controverſies More, and Fiercer, ſo doth it make them more Irreconcileable. No part of the gulf ſo wide, between us and our adverſaries on ether hand.</p>
               <p>If we look upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> how neer are the <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> Ours! and what hindereth them from being entirely ſo, but their zele for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation!</hi> The <hi>Religieuſes</hi> of <hi>Port-royal</hi> ar by the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> accuſed for <hi>Haeretiques;</hi> and by the author of the <hi>Provincial Letters,</hi> juſtified by This, as an adaequate evidence, that <hi>they daily adore the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:59001:187"/>
               <p>If this be an adaequate juſtification from the Suſpicion, we may well conclude it a competent hindrance from the Thing: ſo that were All other controverſies at an end (as in a manner they are) This One muſt keep the Schiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable: And That conſideration is ſufficient to diſcorage the endeavors of ſuch good men, as were thoſe who At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temted, and in good meſure Promoted, the Univerſal peace of Chriſtendom, never to be accompliſhed 'till this bitter root be grub'd up.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, if we look upon the Non-conformiſts, we find many among them who join with us in All other offices, but dare not do ſo in This. They think its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sacredneſs requires extraordinary Caution; and every ſtep toward compliance with our Rubriks, looks like in devotion toward the Myſtery.</p>
               <p>They think themſelves obliged, to examin with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibl rigor, not only Themſelvs, but their Brethren, yea, their Governors too: and every appearance of Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether in Perſons or Ceremonies, is apprehended as infectios and dangeros.</p>
               <p>And of This what can be a more natural conſequence, than that we ſhould exerciſe our zele for the Holy Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not by Performing it, but by Declining it, and Complaining againſt both our Governors and Brethren, for ſo blocking up our way to it!</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we now all Other mountains leveled. Suppoſe the Surplice taken from the Prieſts back, and the Ring from the Brides finger; Suppoſe there wer nether any ſwearing in the Litany, nor croſs in Baptiſm: Yea, ſuppoſe All Liturgies, Ceremonies and Rubriks laid aſide, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table naked, not only of plate, but of cloth; yer while it is thoght that a great part of the Sacraments Honor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in being above all Human Power, in point of forms and circumſtances, and a great part of Our Duty, in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſubmit to the preſcriptions of our Governors; This humor alone will turn it from a <hi>Feſt of Charity,</hi> to a <hi>Rock
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59001:187"/> of Offence;</hi> ſince no wiſdom of Man can contrive how to celebrate it in ſuch a form as ſhall pleaſe thoſe, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in conſcience conform to Any.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. YEA, ſo Contentios is this Superſtition, that it contends with the Sacrament which it ſtriveth to honor; treating it as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Amaſa,</hi> with a kiſs and a ſtab. For amids all it's care concerning the Manner, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the Thing, by denying our Obligation to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formancc.</p>
               <p>With what face can we condemn the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, upon that abſurdity which our ſelvs main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein? How can we decry the doctrine of Accidents, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting without their Subjects; while we labor ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Manner, which is but an Accident, and take away the neceſſity of the Thing, which is the Subject; and That for This very end, that the Accident may ſubſiſt the more perfectly?</p>
               <p>All other Controverſies leav the Subject of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therewith a poſſibility of accommodation: This takes away the One with the Other: To This therefor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove All other, is due that odios glory, which <hi>Lucan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to the litl <hi>Seps,</hi> above all other venomos Creatures:
<q>
                     <l>—tibi palma nocendi:</l>
                     <l>Eripiunt omnes Animam, tu ſola Cadaver.</l>
                  </q> This doth not only turn the moſt gratios Inſtitution to an Uſeleſs Carkas, by robbing it of its ſerviceableneſs to Love, which is its life, but deſtroyeth the very Mater of the Performance it ſelf; yet ſo, as to leave it the miſchievos power of corrupting carkaſſes, which, while themſelvs periſh, infeſt the living.</p>
               <p>This therefor is the ſum of the great honor to which we advance the Sacrament: It may very well be omitted in point of Performance, but cannot be hindered from mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59001:188"/> and perpetuating diſſentions: And this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is the honor, which we thereby pay its great and good Author; that ſince its Miſchievouſneſs is apparent, but not it's Neceſſity, he had do'n us a greater favor if he had never inſtituted it; and a yet greater, if he had ſo declared his will concerning our obligation to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, that we might have eſcaped both Diſobedience to himſelf, and Contentions in his Church, and yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the benefit of ſo gracious a Legacy.</p>
               <p>For how can we juſtifie his Wiſdom or his Goodneſs, if he were ſo careful to bequeath us ſuch a legacy, ſo ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl both to his own honor and his Churches happineſs; yet ſo unkind as to clog it with ſuch condicions, as muſt render it Inacceſſibl to the Moſt, Tormentive to the Beſt, Dangeros to every Single perſon, Miſchievous to the Church in general, and Neceſſary to None? whereas by a plain determination of his will, inforced by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he might have prevented all Inconveniences, and promoted all Good effects.</p>
               <p>Had it not be'n better, that the Chriſtian World had never heard of it, than ſuffered ſo many miſchievs by it? What Fires hath it kindled? What blood hath it drawn? What wounds hath it made in the authors Myſtical body, more grievos to him, than thoſe it commemorateth of his Natural? What member which it hath not tormented? What Church, what Perſon hath eſcaped its miſchievous influence?</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide: Where ar its good fruits? Where is that Church? Where is that Perſon that can in theſe laſt Ages boaſt of any ſo great benefits obteined by it, as may in any proportion pretend to recompence ſo many and great miſchievs?</p>

                  </list> ar queſtions ſo important, that it may be worth our labor, to ſum up all that we have ſaid, or can be ſaid, into thoſe three enquiries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By who's Preſcription?</hi> What Doctor durſt preſume thus to practiſe upon the <hi>Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own Inſtitution?</p>
               <p>Were we to anſwer by conjecture, we ſhould not long deliberate; but we have better evidence than bare ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even as good as can be wiſhed; the teſtimony of an Hiſtorian beyond exception, who could neither dare to impoſe upon the world, nor could himſelf be deceved, in matter of Fact, notoriouſly known, even to the moſt ignorant.</p>
               <p>We have already heard from <hi>Socrates,</hi> who made an end of his Hiſtory in the year of our Lord 441. and ſhall now again more heedfully take his report.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>All Churches over the whole world, on the Sabbath days, in every week celebrate the Myſteries; they of</hi> Alexandria <hi>and</hi> Rome, <hi>upon ſom ancient Tradition; refuſe ſo to do. But the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>who ar neighbors of the</hi> Alexandrians, <hi>and the inhabitants of</hi> Thebais, <hi>do indeed meet on the Sabbath, but partake not the Myſteries, after the manner of Chriſtians: for after they are filled with all manner of meats, about evening, they offer and receve the Myſteries. And again, in</hi> Alexandria, <hi>on the fourth day, and that which
<pb facs="tcp:59001:189"/> is caled the preparation-day, the Scriptures ar read, and the Teachers interpret them, and all things belonging to a meeting ar performed, except the celebration of the Myſteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the firſt clauſe of theſe words ſpeaketh the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament conſtantly celebrated every Sunday, ſo doth the laſt, witneſs the ſame for every other Holy-day: for by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it as a ſingularity in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that their weekly Lectures were defective for want of This; he plainly ſuppoſeth it notorios, that it was celebrated every where els in all Church-aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>And concerning the Sundays-Sacrament, we muſt obſerv.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was but Acceſſary, and that of <hi>Rome</hi> Principal. For as the former furniſhed the later with her Corn, ſo was her ſelf filled with the Wealth and Merchants of <hi>Rome,</hi> for who's ſake ſhe complyed with her cuſtoms: But the voiſinage, who had no ſuch tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, liked not the trade, but refuſed to conſent to their own Metropolis, in ſo groſs an innovation.</p>
               <p>Yea, they thence took ſuch jealoſie, as to ſtand the more ſtifly to ſuch other cuſtoms of their Anceſtors, as all the reſt of the World thoght fit to be changed. Nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, could they well juſtify the One without the Other. For if they refuſed to reneg conſtancy for This very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bicauſe their Anceſtors practiſed it, then could they not deny the conſequence which was preſſed upon them, that they muſt upon the ſame reaſon ſtick to the ancient, but now generally diſuſed circumſtances, which made it the cloſe of a Feſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Evidence, whereon This innovation was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was not derived from Scripture or Reaſon, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther competent Topik; but a pretended Tradition, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Tradition, a Tradition whiſpered to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and her <hi>Zany</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſo cloſe in the ear, that
<pb facs="tcp:59001:190"/> it could not be heard by any other Church equally Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik: not more contrary to the practice of the reſt of the World, than to the very Nature of Tradition, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but Univerſal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The vantage they have ſince made of This inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath made it plain, that they therefor wer thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrios to advance this Sacrament obove all other offices of Worſhip, that they might thereby advance both their own Church above other Churches, and their Prieſts above the Laity in their own: The Former, by exalting this their proper tradition, above the joint practice of all other Churches; and the Later, by putting the People at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Altar, and conſequently from the Prieſt, who muſt needs appear more worthy of reverence, by the privilege he had, to Partake the Sacrament, while the People muſt only Adore it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I QUESTION whether All their Doctrines put together, I am ſure not any One ſingl, hath ſo much of Popery, both Form and Matter, as our modern way of robbing the Lords Supper of due conſtancy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This is the Soul and Life of Popery.</hi> To Equal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with Scripture, and engroſs to themſelvs the power of declaring what is Tradition; This is the Pope's tripl Crown, by this he dominereth over the Conſcience and Underſtanding of the whole Chriſtian world. And This Particular Tradition is the firſt-born of That invention, and the moſt valiant of the whole race. None like it in Boldneſs, for it firſt durſt openly affront the whole world; none like it in Atchievments, for it hath triumphed, not only over the Church Univerſal, but over the Apoſtl himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="tcp:59001:190"/>1. <hi>With the Church Univerſal,</hi> ſhe hath hereby dealt, as her <hi>Nero</hi> did with her Predeceſſor-city. Among all his pranks, none like That of firing the City, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlarging his Houſe upon the ruines. If a City be to the whole World, as a ſingl Houſe is to a whole City; then to make a Private Tradition devour the Univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole World, was another kind of <hi>Neronian</hi> fire, and the title of <hi>Roman Catholik,</hi> an exact tally of <hi>Roma domus fiet, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With the Apoſtl</hi> ſhe hath dealt (if poſſibl) more rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: turned his own artillery upon himſelf, baffled him with his own weapon.</p>
               <p>For He, that he might convince the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that our Lord required conſtancy; pleadeth a private Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>receved of the Lord what I delivered to you.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> employeth the very ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (Trueth only excepted) in direct oppoſition to This very Tradition of the Apoſtl, receved and practiſed by all the Churches of Chriſt: for having no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to rob the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> of This conſtancy, <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>receved it by tradition, that it is not to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> could not oppoſe any thing to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtl's teſtimony concerning His tradition, without giving him the ly; nor was there any other way for Other Churches to avoid This of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And who durſt be ſo rude to the capital Church of the Empire? If All the Chriſtian World have ſo venerated that Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church, as to ſacrifice to her authority their own eyes, who but a race of impudent Heretiks, will queſtion her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, after ſo many ages of poſſeſſion? And if in ſuch a Queſtion as This, the whole Catholik Church yielded to her authority, with what fore-head can any other Church, much more any private Perſon, oppoſe her in any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59001:191"/>
               <p>For if after ſuch a conceſſion, This ſame Church ſhall pretend a Tradition, that it is the duty of every other Church to yield themſelvs up to her conduct, by implicit Faith and blind Obedience, what is this more than is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted? He that hath given up his eyes, ſo as not to diſcover the brighteſt evidence, muſt contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he believ them in any leſs manifeſt: For it is to deny his own conceſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be believed againſt all contrary evidences, whenever ſhe ſhall declare tradition. This therefor, as it was the Firſt and Greateſt eſſay, ſo it is the moſt Proſperos that that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever made or can make, of an unlimited power over the Word of God, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the moſt Material Articl, the Greateſt limb of Popery. Both ſides agree to make this Sacrament the adaequate Teſt, whereby to diſtinguiſh a Romaniſt from ſuch as they call Heretik; and This was the firſt ſtep, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it mounted to the controverted adoration.</p>
               <p>When once it was obteined, that Other offices of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik worſhip might be celebrated without This, it was not hard to gain one ſtep more; for if it be as Well in point of Duty, it muſt ſeem Better in point of Prudence, to make it Venerable by Diſtance, than Cheap by Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And if it be Beſt to make it Venerable, then will it be beſt to ſpeak the Moſt, that can help to make it ſo: and when once it came to This, that he ſpeaketh Beſt who ſpeaketh Moſt: what wonder if <hi>Alexander</hi> claim adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>But to Adore the Sacrament, and Trample upon the Inſtitution: To pretend that This is but a Poſitive Law, and therefor ſubject to the Churches power; and then with an expreſs <hi>non obſtante,</hi> not only to Univerſal tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to our Lords Command; to forbid the One half to the Peopl, exalting their own Authority in the One, and their Wiſdom in the Other againſt His: This was a
<pb facs="tcp:59001:191"/> jump, which even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf durſt not make, but after long exerciſe of omnipotence.</p>
               <p>And as ſhe herein exceeded all her Former Ages, ſo doth ſhe in This All her Other Doctrines. In Other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines they cheat men of their mony, by ſcaring them with Purgatory, ſoothing them with Indulgences, whead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with Merits, cullying them with Abſolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prieſt's own terms, fooling them with Foppiſh ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by This, they pull out their very Eys, forbidding them to believe any of their Senſes.</p>
               <p>If countermanding that ſingular Law which is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to our Lords own Perſon; if tearing away that badge which himſelf made the cogniſance of his Church; if to affront him in Both his Natures, his Divine, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating from his Authority; and his Humane, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing his Image, can deſerv the title; then muſt This above All Doctrines, be moſt worthy to be ſtiled <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In brief and plain: Ether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be followed, in oppoſition to the Church Univerſal, or the Church Univerſal, in oppoſition to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be to be followed, why do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny implicite Faith to any her Other traditions? If the Church Univerſal be to be followed, why do we forſake her in This point of Conſtancy, which ſhe paid the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'till the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> out-faced her?</p>
               <p n="3">III. VVE have ſeen <hi>by who's Preſcription</hi> this Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy hath be'n exerciſed, let us now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire with what Succeſs? And this will occaſion another Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether of the two we have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be aſhamed of? The Practice is two-fold, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part is anſwered by its proper ſucceſs. On the One ſide, the Sacrament is rob'd of Conſtancy, and That is followed by loſs of tolerable Frequency: On the Other ſide, That Loſs is recompenſed by Veneration, and This
<pb facs="tcp:59001:192"/> is followed by as great Miſchiefs as the Author deſigned Benefits.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By loſs of CONSTANCY we have loſt tolerabl Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.</hi> The Obligation ones untyed, and Latitude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, without any other limit, but what love ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; and the Performance dreſt up in ſuch frightful manner, as is more apt to produce Dread than Love; what other fruit can reaſonably be hoped for, than what we ſee, that the generality ſhould rather exerciſe their Aw by Shunning, than their Lov by Frequenting it?</p>
               <p>This was to ſom degree prevented by the Rubrikes of our Church, 'till they wer depoſed from their Authority, by a ſort of men, who making diſtance from <hi>Rome</hi> their meſure of truth, muſt by That rule have reſtored the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, which to baniſh was the proper act of Popery: But <hi>Antipodes,</hi> while they ſtand in greateſt Oppoſition, dwell in the ſame Latitude; and ſo do theſe men with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſom of her worſt Doctrines.</p>
               <p>For as they alſo call it the <hi>Scepter of Christ's Kingdom,</hi> to advance the Eccleſiaſtical Power above the Temporal; ſo do they endeavor to make this Sacrament an inſtrument to ſubject the People to the Miniſter.</p>
               <p>When they hoped to 'ſtabliſh their Diſcipline, how briskly did they ſummon the People to the Communion! How inſolently did they depoſe them All, even ſuch as were every way better than themſelvs, to the ſtate of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens!</hi> not admitting them to the Lords Table 'till they had undergo'n Their examination. But when they found that they could not prevail, ether with the People voluntarily to ſubmit themſelvs, or with the Governors to compel them to it: How quickly did they take pet! How ſullenly did they caſt away the Sacrament, as Uſeleſs to Any good purpoſe, ſince it was So to their Own!</p>
               <p>My baniſhment from the Univerſity caſt me into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where the Diſpute was publikly managed by word and
<pb facs="tcp:59001:192"/> writing, from the Pulpit and from the Preſs; <hi>whether the Lord's Supper wer to be celebrated in an unpresbyterated Church?</hi> and the Negative ſo generally prevailed throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land, that during their whole reign, in ſom pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the very Table it ſelf, and in moſt others, the Uſe of it, was quite caſt out of the Church.</p>
               <p>When the Church of <hi>England</hi> was about to be reſtored, and their Repreſentatives wer deſired to make their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals; that they might ether hide or juſtify ſo great a neglect, they moved to be freed from That Rubrike, which obligeth the peopl to communicate at leaſt three times in every year: And to This day they make it a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct cauſe of ſeparation; ſo that ſom who join with us in other offices, dare not do it in This: And their greateſt Champion, thogh he have his proper Congregation, boſteth that he hath not 'miniſtered it theſe eighteen years; with no leſs Non-conformity to his own pretences, than to the ſtabliſhed government.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One pretence is, <hi>that nothing muſt be do'n in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik worſhip of God, without expreſs warrant in his word:</hi> Then certainly much leſs, muſt any thing be omitted, which his Command hath made neceſſary. For the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precept for Decency, may virtually contein ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as our Governors ſhall judge Decent; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a Particular and Expreſs warrant, can free us from a Particular Inſtitution, not only Expreſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, but ſeveral ways Inculcated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another pretence is, that <hi>our Church is not rightly conſtituted according to the mind of Chriſt:</hi> And we have diſcovered by the Nature of the thing, by the language of the Apoſtls, and by the unanimos conſent of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, that the Sacraments ar indiſpenſibl marks of a Chriſtian Church; which ſince his Congregation wants, by his own principleſs he muſt abandon it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb facs="tcp:59001:193"/>3. A Third great pretence is, that <hi>We have too much Popery in our Worſhip:</hi> And we have found that robbing the Publik worſhip of This Sacrament, is the very <hi>Soul and Body of Popery;</hi> but with This difference, that the Popiſh Doctors intended to make it bleed away ſomthing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; and Non-conformiſts bleed it to death.</p>
               <p>WE ſee whence our neglect of the Sacrament took it's firſt Birth, and whence it's Nouriſhment. Popery gave it the one, and Schiſm the other: Yet how many among our ſelvs cheriſh it, that renounce both Parent and Nurſe! Glad of the liberty which (right or wrong) they enjoyed during our confuſions, and loth to return to the troubl they ſuffered, from ſuch a curb to their dear luſts and eaſe.</p>
               <p>They find that divines require no leſs for a worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, than for a ſaving Repentance: <hi>Repentance</hi> they preſs as abſolutely Neceſſary, but the Communion they think not ſo: Who then can be ſo ſottiſh, as to delay his Repentance, without giving the Sacrament as long a day? Every mans Reaſon muſt needs concurr with his Sloth, to perſuade him, that if it be a damnable Sin to com Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, but None to Forbear; then muſt it needs be his wiſeſt courſ, to avoid a task, dubly prejudical, firſt to his Eaſe, and then to his Salvation.</p>
               <p>When our Lord commanded us to <hi>pluck out our eys and cut off our hands,</hi> he enforced it with a Reaſon, as cogent as the Command could be rigid: <hi>For it is better to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life with One ey foot or hand, than to be caſt into Hell-fire with two.</hi> But ſo to ſtate this duty as to ſay, If you will do This, you muſt quit your beloved luſts; but if you will not do it, you miſs ſom benefits, but incurr no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; how few ſuch a declaration will perſuade rather to renounce their luſts and eaſe, than This (Duty ſhall I call it? no, but) Burthen; Reaſon might have taght our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors to Conjectur, and Experience compelleth us to bewail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Experience,</hi> which many call the fools miſtreſs, bicauſe
<pb facs="tcp:59001:193"/> thoſe who apprehend not other evidence, cannot avoid This: <hi>Experience</hi> which is many times the Severeſt, and alway the Beſt inſtructor; doth ſo plainly and ſadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us, that however excuſable Other ages may have be'n, who thoght themſelvs ſecure from the ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, our Own and Future times cannot be ſo, if we be not convinced by them.</p>
               <p>We ſomtimes ſee men encumber their lands, when they intend to grace them, with Fair but Fruitleſs bildings, and then ſell houſes, land, and all, to pay the ſo contracted debt: But we never ſee any ſo fond of ſuch bildings, as to ſell the Land for their preſervation, if by pulling them down, they can pay the debt with the materials. Let us be as wiſe in our generation: our 'forefathers thoght (as ſuch bilders uſually do) that the Sacrament could well bear, and be improved by the coſt they put it to; that it would be more advanced both in honor and power, than preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, by abatement of conſtancy; but never thoght of ſtaking its very Being, againſt any hopes whatever: That, they thoght ſecured by the Laws of the Church, and the unfailing practice of it's very worſt members; who for ſhame of their neighbors or fear of their governors, durſt not neglect it at any of the appointed ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>But now, that the late Schiſm hath out-miſchiefed all their fears, it is not to be doubted, but thoſe very wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who heretofore diſcoraged the performance by their rigors, wer they now living, would no leſs induſtrioſly preſs it; had they no better reaſon than this, that the bild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings go with the land; bicauſ thoſe who think it needleſs to receve the Sacrament, cannot think it neceſſary to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min themſelvs by way of preparation for it.</p>
               <p>Let us then learn by experience: we have ſeen the trial of Both ways: Primitive Chriſtians practiſed Conſtancy with as great Succeſs as Obedience; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> firſt ſeduced the world from it, and thereby advanced Themſelvs more than the Sacrament; Our <hi>Schiſmatiks</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:59001:194"/> out-ſhot the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only Abated, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Office, root and branch. What need we leſs intelligibl comments, upon our Lord's or Apoſtl's words? our very ſenſes inform us what is to be do'n: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever former ages may be excuſed by the goodneſs of their intentions, we cannot be ſo, if we refuſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by manifeſt experience, plainly confuting their plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibl deſignes.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THE other part of the practice, is the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of REVERENCE: for as <hi>Frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> for want of a Damm to fence it, is ſwallowed up; ſo <hi>Reverence</hi> for want of one to reſtrain it, hath ſwollen fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further 'till it came to <hi>Adoration:</hi> and this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by a ſucceſs ſo much worſ than the Other, as a Miſchief is worſ than Nothing: for it is miſchievos both to the <hi>Honor of our Lord, and the Peace of his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>To the HONOR of our Lord:</hi> bicauſe it reſtoreth Both thoſe Religions which he came and died to aboliſh; turning This, which he inſtituted for a livree of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to a cloak both of <hi>Heatheniſm and Judaiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> by making it an Idol, much after the Old Pagan mode: For the Old Heathen believed they could by force of words, bring their God to enhabit the ſtatu they conſecrated to him, and then worſhiped That ſtatu, not a as carved piece of wood, but as the body of the God; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> believ they can by like force of words, make bread and wine the Body of Chriſt, and then worſhip it after the manner of the heathen; yet eat it too, and therein exceed them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> by burying true Spiritual worſhip under a heap of dumb ceremonies. Our Lord gave This as a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Goſpel-worſhip; <hi>God is a Spirit, and they
<pb facs="tcp:59001:194"/> that worſhip him, muſt worſhip in Spirit and in Truth:</hi> But the Papiſts have turned Spiritual worſhip out of door, to make room for a maſs of pageantry, who's Myſteries ar no more underſtood by the Prieſt, than is the Language by the Peopl.</p>
               <p>But thogh no meaning can be perceved in the Retail, yet This is plain in the Groſs; that the Sacrament is to be Admired, but not Underſtood.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>To the PEACE of the Church,</hi> the Ten Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions have not be'n ſo pernicios. The King of <hi>France</hi> after all his bloody atchievments, muſt yield it a greater right to his vaunt, <hi>Behold what deſtructions I have wroght upon the earth!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God be bleſſed, we ly not at preſent under ſuch violent paroxyſms as our 'forefathers ſuffered: Nether Warr nor Perſecution rage among us, but we hear of Oppreſſions among our Neighbors, Plots among our ſelvs, Jeloſies, Diſputes, Diſtractions, which thogh they do not utterly Deſtroy, do yet Diſturb the peace of the Church; as Fears and Perplexities of conſcience do the ſouls of it's beſt members.</p>
               <p>Theſe ar the fruits of our modern way of honoring the bleſſed Sacrament: Neglect of Conſtancy hath produced Conſtancy of Neglect; we have So put it at Diſtance, as to put it out of ſight. Yea, it is worſ than Deſtroyed, for it is made Deſtructive of that Spiritual devotion toward God, that mutual Charity toward each other, that inward Comfort in our Own ſouls, which our Lord inſtituted it to advance.</p>
               <p n="5">V. OUR THIRD enquiry is, <hi>What Need?</hi> For it oght not to be thoght, but the Neceſſity muſt be proportionate to the Remedy. Nice perſons ſomtimes take phyſik without need, only to prevent they know not what: in ſuch caſes the Phyſician preſcribes none but gentl
<pb facs="tcp:59001:195"/> medecines; ſuch as may do no more, than only purge the patient out of ſom of his ſuperfluos mony: Such a courſ therefor as we find taken with This inſtitution, muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us to expect ſom very urgent Neceſſity, or ſom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and great Danger, no other way to be eſcaped.</p>
               <p>And a great danger we hear of; A danger of contemt. But what contemt? Is this holy Bread any where caſt to the dogs? Is this Cup worſ abuſed to drunkenneſs? Is the whole Supper any where profaned as the Apoſtl teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to have be'n the by <hi>Corinthians?</hi> or as their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſlanderoſly reported of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians?</hi> All this were ſo much leſs than the abuſes it now ſuffereth from the remedies, as Luſt is leſs than Murder: but the Leaſt of them is incomparably more than our greateſt fears.</p>
               <p>For indeed there is no pretence of any other danger, than Negative or Comparative: <hi>It will not be capabl of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration at</hi> Rome, <hi>nor of Veneration among our Selvs; 'twill be as cheap as Common-prayer, by too much familiarity: it muſt therefor keep ſtate like the Eaſtern kings, who preſerv Aw in their peopl by keeping Diſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Diſtance cauſeth Aw, cannot be denied: This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection verifieth it. For while we look upon it at diſtance, it looketh dreadful as a Lion; but if we com to a cloſer vieu, we ſhall find it a leſs formidabl beaſt.</p>
               <p>To this end we have already diſtinguiſhed the world into it's two parties, the <hi>Godly</hi> and the Ungodly; and found that from nether of them was any ſuch danger to be feared: Not from the <hi>Godly,</hi> for no Conſtancy will make them quit their Reverence; Not from the Ungodly, for they have none worth preſerving.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Godly will never quit Reverence upon any the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Frequency,</hi> as plainly appeareth by their uniting Both in Prayer: <hi>Evening and Morning and at Noon-day will I pray, and that Instantly,</hi> ſaid <hi>David.</hi> Not the leſs <hi>Inſtantly,</hi> bicauſ <hi>Conſtantly.</hi> Such Conſtant Experience oght to deal
<pb facs="tcp:59001:195"/> with this Fear, as its patrons pretend Conſtant performance will with Reverence, Abate at leaſt, perhaps Deſtroy it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſhew of Reverence which Ungodly men bring to the Communion is not worth preſerving,</hi> much leſs is it worth purchaſing at ſo dear a rate, as <hi>diſobedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have<note n="b" place="bottom">p. 303.</note> lately examined the Pageant, and found, that however goodly ſhew it makes in the eyes of children and the populace, it muſt be contemptibl in the eyes of God, who ſeeth and hateth it's want of inward life; which it Therefor wanteth, bicauſ it wanteth ſuch Frequency as is moſt likely to beget it.</p>
               <p>Since therefor True Reverence, which alone is Worth our care, Needs it not, bicauſ it is ſecure from danger; and that Empty ſhew of revercnce which is in danger, is not worth our care to preſerv it; From This topik of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, there is not to be had one grain to turn the emty ſcale.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, in This very Topik we ſhall meet ſuch conſiderations, as without help from any Other, ſhall very much outweigh thoſe fears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is much better run the riſque of abating Reverence, than of Loſing the Sacrament it ſelf.</hi> Somthing, however cheap, is better than Nothing; and Obedience, than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. But it is not ſingl Diſobedience, when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied (as here) with pretence of Prudence: which no leſs affronteth our Lord's Wiſdom than his Authority; oblikely intimating that he could not 'foreſee or prevent the danger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Probability is much lighter than Experience.</hi> We do but Suſpect the danger, and we have Experience to the contrary. On One ſide; more than 400 years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, proved that Conſtancy and Reverence drew happily together to God's glory and his Churches benefit: On the Other ſide, many hundred years experience hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
<pb facs="tcp:59001:196"/> that by their ſeparation, a multitude of miſchievs have overwhelmed the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. Livy</hi> ſaid <hi>That Experience is the beſt judge and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of Laws:</hi> If it may correct Laws, much better may it Diſobedience to Laws.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This probabl Fear is anſwered by a more probabl Hope, that by their re-union, Common-Prayer would gain more than the Sacrament loſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have found that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and after him St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> uſed this Sacrament as an argument for <hi>reverence in God's houſ:</hi> and the Later went a ſtep further, improving it for <hi>Purity of life:</hi> if the Argument be good, why ſhould it be loſt?</p>
               <p>Hnd not <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> accompanied the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> in their addreſs to the Prophet, their three ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had periſhed: and how much of devotion is loſt, for want of joining the Lords Supper with other offices of his worſhip, who can divine?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If Prayer and other Religios offices gain not altogether ſo much as the Sacrament may loſe; yet will the ſervice of God be advanced by the Great; bicauſe Frequency will abundantly recompence the diſadvantage in the Particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quick (thogh Light) returns make rich merchants: and a little gain repeted <hi>every Sunday and other Holiday,</hi> will enrich piety, thogh purchaſed with greater abatement from the Sacrament, as it is now rarely celebrated.</p>
               <p>Thus our adverſaries own Topik, <hi>Prudence</hi> will write upon their pretended neceſſity for abatement of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, <hi>Mene Mene tekel:</hi> how light then will it appear, when ſo many and weighty obligations ſhall be weighed againſt it!</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poſitive Command</hi> of our Lord, not only Expreſsly enjoined, but Carefully Recommended, by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſeaſon of the Inſtitution, in the Laſt night of his
<pb facs="tcp:59001:196"/> Life, and no leſs carefully interpreted by poſthum revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after his death: The <hi>Singular worth of the Duty it ſelf,</hi> appropriate to his Own Perſon, the Livree of his Church, the Monument and Effigies of his Death and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; <hi>The great vertues of the performance,</hi> the cement of charity among his members, the Comfort of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, the advancer of devotion in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt ſo great a weight, nothing caſt into the oppoſit ſcale, but the miſtaken ſound of an unhappy word, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted and abuſed upon loſs of it's key, by Modern Doctors; but That miſtaken Sound again infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed, by the Apoſtl's deſign manifeſtly imploying That very word for enforcement of Conſtancy; and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Modern Doctors, out-voted by the unanimos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of more than 400 years univerſal practice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik church, which having not yet loſt the key, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtood the Apoſtl's mind, by uninterrupted tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; not to be deſtroyed but by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor by That, upon any other Evidence, than of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Tradition; not to be gainſaid, thogh not to be credited, by other leſs potent Churches.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. SO great a weight born up by an emty ſcale! This could never be, did we pay This Sacrament That Reverence which is due to it.</p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>That which is Due to it:</hi> For we oght to be careful in diſtinguiſhing: There is One kind of Reverence Due to Gods Laws, and Another to his <hi>Decrees: Moſes</hi> long ſince and very clearly ſtated the difference, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but thoſe things which are reveled belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secret things to God,</hi> who hath reſerved them for his own Knowlege and Execution: and the Reverence which we ar to pay to them, requireth us to keep an Awful Diſtance;
<pb facs="tcp:59001:197"/> not to intrude, but to admire, and cry out <hi>Oh the depth of the riches hoth of Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchabl</hi> — But <hi>Thoſe things which ar reveled belong to us:</hi> Faithful Study and Diligent Practice is the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they claim. <hi>Oh how I lov thy Law! All the day long is my ſtudy in it,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> in conformity to his character of the <hi>Bleſſed man</hi> Pſ. 1.</p>
               <p>And it is wonderfully unhappy that our moſt learned ages have moſt groſsly erred on Both ſides. Concerning the <hi>Secret things that bolong to God,</hi> how irreverently buſy! To marſhal his Preſence and Decrees in due order, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe limits for his Juſtice and Goodneſs, to meſure the influences of his Decrees and his Grace upon our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is every one's work: While <hi>thoſe things which ar reveled</hi> concerning this Sacrament, ar reverenced by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treated as Myſteries, with an Awful Diſtance, with Admiration, Ignorance, and Forbearance.</p>
               <p>I am therefor ſo farr from depoſeing it from due Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that my whole endeavor hath be'n to reſtore it from the groſſeſt Contemt, which hath ſo long left it in the meaneſt ſtate of Neglect, <hi>Unſtudied and Unpractiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, it is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtudied:</hi> in the mids of that multitude of diſputes, which have ſo long and ſo much peſtered the Chriſtian world, concerning Sacraments in General, and This in Particular, ſtill our Lord's Inſtitution lieth <hi>Unſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: Unſtudied</hi> as a <hi>Law,</hi> bicauſe <hi>Overſtudied</hi> as a Myſtery: Unſtudied in what <hi>belongs to Us,</hi> bicauſe Overſtudied in <hi>what belongs to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What? can he be ſaid to have ſtudied the Law, that underſtands not it's firſt Rudiments? That knoweth not whether it be a Law, or no? Whether it be a Law Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, or only Condicional? Is he learned in a Law, that knoweth not how farr, or how often it obligeth to Action? When, and in what caſes the obligation ceaſeth? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be to Love a Law, what is to Slight it? If this be Reverence, what is Contemt?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59001:197"/>
               <p>A Contemt ſo much the Greater, by how much Leſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor the ſtudy requireth. Did it require the reading of many large volums, the loſs of much ſleep, the waſt of much time; the Neglect might be imputed, not ſo much to want of Reverence, as of Corage: But <hi>All the words of this Law,</hi> were delivered by our Lord in one Breath, and explicated by his Apoſtl in a Few Lines: and how can you pretend Reverence to the One or the Other, if you let the leaſt tittl fall to the ground?</p>
               <p>I pray' now, have you indeed ſtudied <hi>All the words of this Law?</hi> Have you well examined what bread and cup the Demonſtrative <hi>THIS</hi> points at? or what is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Imperative <hi>DO?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or have you ſtudied <hi>All the words</hi> of the Apoſtl's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Yea, have you examined All it's clauſes, or the Deſign of them All? Why did he charge his <hi>Corinthians</hi> with profaning the Lord's Supper in All their meetings? And how did he make good That Charge? What meant he by ſuch induſtrios inſerting and repeting a clauſ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned by any Evangeliſt? and what ſtandard doth it relate to? What is the intent of the whole 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſ? how doth it ſumm up the evidence of the 'foregoing, or ſupport the inferences following?</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other main limbs, Which of our aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Reverence have honored with any enquiry?</p>
               <p>If to Neglect the moſt fundamental clauſes, and largeſt limbs of a Diſcourſ, ſo to handl a Law as to diſabl it from obligeing, ſo to order a Duty as to render it impracticable, be to pay Reverence, I cannot but confeſs my ſelf gilty of haveing denied it.</p>
               <p>On the Other ſide I have be'n ſo bold, both with our Lord's and Apoſtl's words, as to examin every ſyllabl and every look: taken them to a ſtrict account, what ſervice they do to the author's deſigne? What agreement they maintein with their fellow-members? what order they keep, and why? Traced the diatribe throgh all it's turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb facs="tcp:59001:198"/> and hunted out the reaſon of them all: Suffered not the leaſt Phoenomenon to 'ſcape the moſt rigid exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and over and above, compared all with the practice of the other Apoſtls and the primitive Churches.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the Beſt way of Reverence, except One, wherein I hope my good reader will join with me; which is, to paſs from <hi>Studying</hi> to <hi>Doing all the words of This Law.</hi>
